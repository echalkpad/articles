You know Kung-Fu. Researchers at HRL Laboratories have discovered that when you use transcranial direct current stimulation to send the brain activity of commercial and military pilots into the heads of novice pilots subjects can essentially learn to fly in a realistic flight simulator.

The researchers discovered that "subjects who received brain stimulation via electrode-embedded head caps improved their piloting abilities.

"As we discover more about optimizing, personalizing, and adapting brain stimulation protocols, we'll likely see these technologies become routine in training and classroom environments," said Dr. Matthew Phillips. "It's possible that brain stimulation could be implemented for classes like drivers' training, SAT prep, and language learning."

HRL is owned by The Boeing Company and General Motors and is working in sensors and materials. This technology is far from commercial grade but if zapping your brain can teach you how to fly a multi-ton piece of very specialized transport equipment then I'm kind of afraid and/or enthused.
