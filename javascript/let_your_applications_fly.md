## Introduction

Feathers sits right on top of Express, one of the most popular web frameworks for [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/). If you are not familiar with Express head over to the [Express Guides](http://expressjs.com/guide.html) to get an idea. Feathers works the exact same way except that `var app = require('express')();` is replaced with `var app = require('feathers')()`. The small differences and additional functionality available is outline in the following documentation.

## Configuration

### REST

Exposing services through a RESTful JSON interface is enabled by default. If you only want to use SocketIO call `app.disabled('feathers rest')` _before_ registering any services.

To set service parameters in a middleware, just attach it to the `req.feathers` object which will become the params for any resulting service call:

```
app.use(function(req, res) {
 req.feathers.data = 'Hello world';
});

app.use('/todos', {
 get: function(name, params, callback) {
 console.log(params.data); // -> 'Hello world'
 callback(null, {
 id: name,
 params: params,
 description: "You have to do " + name + "!"
 });
 }
});
```

### SocketIO

To expose services via [SocketIO](http://socket.io/) call `app.configure(feathers.socketio())`. It is also possible pass a `function(io) {}` when initializing the provider where `io` is the main SocketIO object so you can listen to custom events, change the configuration or add [authorization](https://github.com/LearnBoost/socket.io/wiki/Authorizing):

```
app.configure(feathers.socketio(function(io) {
 io.on('connection', function(socket) {
 socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' });
 socket.on('my other event', function (data) {
 console.log(data);
 });
 });

 io.set('authorization', function (handshakeData, callback) {
 app.lookup('users').find({
 username: handshakeData.username,
 password: handshakeData.password
 }, callback);
 });
}));
```

Once the server has been started with `app.listen()` the SocketIO object is available as `app.io`.

## API

### listen

`app.listen([port])` starts the application on the given port. Before calling the original [Express app.listen([port])](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.listen) Feathers will initialize the SocketIO server (if set up) and call all services `setup(app, path)` methods in the order they have been registered.

```
var app = feathers();
app.use('/my/todos', {
 setup: function(app, path) {
 // path -> 'my/todos'
 }
});

var server = app.listen(8080);

server.close();
```

### lookup

`app.lookup(path)` returns the wrapped service object for the given path. Note that Feathers internally creates a new object from each registered service. This means that the object returned by `lookup` will provide the same methods and functionality as the original service but also functionality added by Feathers (most notably it is possible to listen to service events). `path` can be the service name with or without leading and trailing slashes.

```
app.use('/my/todos', {
 create: function(data, params, callback) {
 callback(null, data);
 }
});

var todoService = app.lookup('my/todos');
// todoService is an event emitter
todoService.on('created', function(todo) {
 console.log('Created todo', todo);
});
```

### use

`app.use([path], service)` works just like [Express app.use([path], middleware)](http://expressjs.com/api.html#app.use) but additionally allows to register a service object (an object which at least provides one of the service methods as outlined in the Services section) instead of the middleware function. Note that REST services are registered in the same order as any other middleware so the below example will allow the `/todos` service only to [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) authenticated users.

```
// Serve public folder for everybody
app.use(feathers.static(__dirname + '/public');
// Make sure that everything else only works with authentication
app.use(function(req,res,next){
 if(req.isAuthenticated()){
 next();
 } else {
 // 401 Not Authorized
 next(new Error(401));
 }
});
// Add a service.
app.use('/todos', {
 get: function(name, params, callback) {
 callback(null, {
 id: name,
 description: "You have to do " + name + "!"
 });
 }
});
```

## Services

A service can be any JavaScript object that offers one or more of the `find`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `remove` and `setup` service methods with the following signatures:

```
var myService = {
 find: function(params, callback) {},
 get: function(id, params, callback) {},
 create: function(data, params, callback) {},
 update: function(id, data, params, callback) {},
 remove: function(id, params, callback) {},
 setup: function(app) {}
}
```

All callbacks follow the `function(error, data)` NodeJS convention. `params` can contain any additional parameters, for example the currently authenticated user. REST service calls set `params.query` with the query parameters (e.g. a query string like `?status=active&type=user` becomes `{ query: { status: "active", type: "user" } }`).

### find

`find(params, callback)` retrieves a list of all resources from the service. Ideally use `params.query` for things like filtering and paging so that REST calls like `todo?status=completed&user=10` work right out of the box.

**REST**

```
GET todo?status=completed&user=10
```

**SocketIO**

```
socket.emit('todo::find', {
 query: {
 status: 'completed'
 user: 10
 }
}, function(error, data) {
});
```

### get

`get(id, params, callback)` retrieves a single resource with the given `id` from the service.

**REST**

**SocketIO**

```
socket.emit('todo::get', 1, {}, function(error, data) {

});
```

### create

`create(data, params, callback)` creates a new resource with `data`. The callback should be called with the newly created resource data.

**REST**

```
POST todo
{ "description": "I really have to iron" }
```

By default the body can be eihter JSON or form encoded as long as the content type is set accordingly.

**SocketIO**

```
socket.emit('todo::create', {
 description: 'I really have to iron'
}, {}, function(error, data) {
});
```

### update

`update(id, data, params, callback)` updates the resource identified by `id` using `data`. The callback should be called with the updated resource data.

**REST**

```
PUT todo/2
{ "description": "I really have to do laundry" }
```

**SocketIO**

```
socket.emit('todo::update', 2, {
 description: 'I really have to do laundry'
}, {}, function(error, data) {
 // data -> { id: 2, description: "I really have to do laundry" }
});
```

### remove

`remove(id, params, callback)` removes the resource with `id`. The callback should be called with the removed resource.

**REST**

**SocketIO**

```
socket.emit('todo::remove', 2, {}, function(error, data) {
});
```

### setup

`setup(app, path)` initializes the service passing an instance of the Feathers application and the path it has been registered on. The SocketIO server is available via `app.io`. `setup` is a great way to connect services:

```
var todoService = {
 get: function(name, params, callback) {
 callback(null, {
 id: name,
 description: 'You have to ' + name + '!'
 });
 }
};

var myService = {
 setup: function(app) {
 this.todo = app.lookup('todo');
 },

 get: function(name, params, callback) {
 this.todo.get('take out trash', {}, function(error, todo) {
 callback(error, {
 name: name,
 todo: todo
 });
 });
 }
}

feathers()
 .use('todo', todoService)
 .use('my', myService)
 .listen(8000);
```

You can see the combination when going to `http://localhost:8000/my/test`.

**Pro tip:**

Bind the apps `lookup` method to your service to always look your services up dynamically:

```
var myService = {
 setup: function(app) {
 this.lookup = app.lookup.bind(app);
 },

 get: function(name, params, callback) {
 this.lookup('todos').get('take out trash', {}, function(error, todo) {
 callback(null, {
 name: name,
 todo: todo
 });
 });
 }
}
```

## Events

Any registered service will be automatically turned into an event emitter that emits events when a resource has changed, that is a `create`, `update` or `remove` service call returned successfully. It is therefore possible to bind to the below events via `app.lookup(servicename).on()` and, if enabled, all events will also broadcast to all connected SocketIO clients in the form of `<servicepath> <eventname>`. Note that the service path will always be stripped of leading and trailing slashes regardless of how it has been registered (e.g. `/my/service/` will become `my/service`).

### created

The `created` event will be published with the callback data when a service `create` calls back successfully.

```
app.use('/todos', {
 create: function(data, params, callback) {
 callback(null, data);
 }
});

app.lookup('/todos').on('created', function(todo) {
 console.log('Created todo', todo);
});

app.lookup('/todos').create({
 description: 'We have to do something!'
}, {}, function(error, callback) {
 // ...
});

app.listen(8000);
```

**SocketIO**

```
<script src="http://localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
 var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8000/');

 socket.on('todos created', function(todo) {
 console.log('Got a new Todo!', todo);
 });
</script>
```

### updated

The `updated` event will be published with the callback data when a service `update` calls back successfully.

```
app.use('/my/todos/', {
 update: function(id, data, params, callback) {
 callback(null, data);
 }
});

app.listen(8000);
```

**SocketIO**

```
<script src="http://localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
 var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8000/');

 socket.on('my/todos updated', function(todo) {
 console.log('Got an updated Todo!', todo);
 });

 socket.emit('my/todos::update', 1, {
 description: 'Updated description'
 }, {}, function(error, callback) {
 // Do something here
 });
</script>
```

### removed

The `removed` event will be published with the callback data when a service `remove` calls back successfully.

```
app.use('/todos', {
 remove: function(id, params, callback) {
 callback(null, { id: id });
 }
});

app.lookup('/todos').remove(1, {}, function(error, callback) {
 // ...
});

app.listen(8000);
```

**SocketIO**

```
<script src="http://localhost:8000/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
 var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:8000/');

 socket.on('todos removed', function(todo) {
 // Remove element showing the Todo from the page
 $('#todo-' + todo.id).remove();
 });
</script>
```

## Why?

We know... Oh God another NodeJS framework! We really didn't want to add another name to the long list of NodeJS web frameworks but also wanted to explore a different approach than any other framework we have seen. We strongly believe that data is the core of the web and should be the focus of web applications.

We also think that your data resources can and should be encapsulated in such a way that they can be scalable, easily testable and self contained. The classic web MVC pattern used to work well but is becoming antiquated in today's web.

With that being said there are some amazing frameworks already out there and we wanted to leverage the ideas that have been put into them, which is why Feathers is built on top of [Express](http://expressjs.com) and is inspired in part by [Sails](http://sailsjs.org), [Flatiron](http://flatironjs.org) and [Derby](http://derbyjs.com).
