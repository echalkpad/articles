You might have heard about Mozilla's [WebExtensions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebExtensions "Mozillaâ€™s WebExtensions Wiki Page"), our implementation of a new browser extension API for writing multiprocess-compatible add-ons. Maybe you've been wondering what it was about, and how you could use it. Well, I'm here to help! I think the [MDN's WebExtensions docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions "MDNâ€™s WebExtensions Documentation") are a pretty great place to start:

> WebExtensions are a new way to write Firefox extensions.

> The technology is developed for cross-browser compatibility: to a large extent the API is compatible with the [extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions "Chromeâ€™s Extension API") supported by Google Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox with just a few changes. The API is also fully compatible with [multiprocess Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox "a.k.a. Electrolysis").

The only thing I would add is that while Mozilla is implementing most of the API that Chrome and Opera support, we're not restricting ourselves to only that API. Where it makes sense, we will be adding new functionality and talking with other browser makers about implementing it as well. Finally, since the WebExtension API is still under development, it's probably best if you use [Firefox Nightly](https://nightly.mozilla.org/ "Download Nightly Here") for this tutorial, so that you get the most up-to-date, standards-compliant behaviour. But keep in mind, this is still experimental technology -- things might break!

## Starting off

Okay, let's start with a reasonably simple add-on. We'll add a button, and when you click it, it will open up [one of my favourite sites](http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/ "Cat Gifs!") in a new tab.

The first file we'll need is a [`manifest.json`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest "Chromeâ€™s Manifest Documentation"), to tell Firefox about our add-on.

```
{
 "manifest_version": 2,
 "name": "Cat Gifs!",
 "version": "1.0",
 "applications": {
 "gecko": {
 "id": "catgifs@mozilla.org"
 }
 },

 "browser_action": {
 "default_title": "Cat Gifs!"
 }
}
```

Great! We're done! Hopefully your code looks a little [like this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-1 "Step One"). Of course, we have no idea if it works yet, so let's install it in Firefox (we're using Firefox Nightly for the latest implementation). You could try to drag the `manifest.json`, or the whole directory, onto Firefox, but that really won't give you what you want.

## Installing

To make Firefox recognize your extension as an add-on, you need to give it a zip file which ends in `.xpi`, so let's make one of those by first installing [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/ "7-Zipâ€™s website"), and then typing `7z a catgifs.xpi manifest.json`. (If you're on Mac or Linux, the `zip` command should be built-in, so just type `zip catgifs.xpi manifest.json`.) Then you can drag the `catgifs.xpi` onto Firefox, and it will show you an error because our extension is unsigned.

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/2-FirstError-500x317.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/2-FirstError-250x159.png%20250w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/2-FirstError.png%201167w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29290" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/2-FirstError.png)

We can work around this by going to `about:config`, typing `xpinstall.signatures.required` in the search box, double-clicking the entry to set it to false, and then closing that tab. After that, when we drop `catgifs.xpi` onto Firefox, we get the option to install our new add-on!

> It's important to note that beginning with Firefox 44 (later this year), add-ons will [require a signature](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Addons/Extension_Signing "Extension Signing Documentation") to be installed on Firefox Beta or Release versions of the browser, so even if you set the preference shown below, you will soon still need to run Firefox Nightly or Developer Edition to follow this tutorial.

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/3-SuccessDialog-500x318.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/3-SuccessDialog-250x159.png%20250w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/3-SuccessDialog.png%201169w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29291" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/3-SuccessDialog.png)

Of course, our add-on doesn't do a whole lot yet.

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/4-ButtonClick-500x317.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/4-ButtonClick-250x159.png%20250w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/4-ButtonClick.png%201169w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29292" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/4-ButtonClick.png)

So let's fix that!

## Adding features

First, we'll add the following lines to `manifest.json`, above the line containing [`browser_action`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction "Chromeâ€™s Browser Action Documentation"):

```
 "background": {
 "scripts": ["background.js"],
 "persistent": false
 },
```

now, of course, that's pointing at a `background.js` file that doesn't exist yet, so we should create that, too. Let's paste the following javascript in it:

```
'use strict';

/*global chrome:false */

chrome.browserAction.setBadgeText({text: '(ãƒ„)'});
chrome.browserAction.setBadgeBackgroundColor({color: '#eae'});

chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(aTab) {
 chrome.tabs.create({'url': 'http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/', 'active': true});
});
```

And you should get something that looks [like this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-2 "Step Two"). Re-create the add-on by typing `7z a catgifs.xpi manifest.json background.js` (or `zip catgifs.xpi manifest.json background.js`), and drop `catgifs.xpi` onto Firefox again, and now, when we click the button, we should get a new tab! ðŸ˜„

[![Cat Gifs!](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/5-CatGifs.gif)](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/5-CatGifs.gif)

## Automating the build

I don't know about you, but I ended up typing `7z a catgifs.xpi manifest.json` a disappointing number of times, and wondering why my `background.js` file wasn't running. Since I know where this blog post is ending up, I know we're going to be adding a bunch more files, so I think it's time to add a build script. I hear that the go-to build tool these days is [`gulp`](http://gulpjs.com/ "Gulpâ€™s Homepage"), so I'll wait here while you [go install that](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#getting-started "Gulpâ€™s Installation Instructions"), and c'mon back when you're done. (I needed to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/ "Nodeâ€™s Homepage"), and then gulp twice. I'm not sure why.)

So now that we have gulp installed, we should make a file named `gulpfile.js` to tell it how to build our add-on.

```
'use strict';

var gulp = require('gulp');

var files = ['manifest.json', 'background.js'];
var xpiName = 'catgifs.xpi';

gulp.task('default', function () {
 console.log(files, xpiName)
});
```

Once you have that file looking something [like this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-3 "Step Three"), you can type `gulp`, and see output that looks something like this:

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/6-GulpOutput-500x184.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/6-GulpOutput-250x92.png%20250w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/6-GulpOutput.png%20802w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29294" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/6-GulpOutput.png)

Now, you may notice that we didn't actually build the add-on. To do that, we will need to install another package to zip things up. So, type `npm install gulp-zip`, and then change the `gulpfile.js` to contain the following:

```
'use strict';

var gulp = require('gulp');
var zip = require('gulp-zip');

var files = ['manifest.json', 'background.js'];
var xpiName = 'catgifs.xpi';

gulp.task('default', function () {
 gulp.src(files)
 .pipe(zip(xpiName))
 .pipe(gulp.dest('.'));
});
```

Once your `gulpfile.js` looks [like this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-4 "Step Four"), when we run it, it will create the `catgifs.xpi` (as we can tell by looking at the timestamp, or by deleting it and seeing it get re-created).

## Fixing a bug

Now, if you're like me, you clicked the button a whole bunch of times, to test it out and make sure it's working, and you might have ended up with a lot of tabs. While this will ensure you remain extra-chill, it would probably be nicer to only have one tab, either creating it, or switching to it if it exists, when we click the button. So let's go ahead and add that.

[![Lots and lots of cats.](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/7-ManyTabbys.gif)](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/7-ManyTabbys.gif)

The first thing we want to do is see if the tab exists, so let's edit the `browserAction.onClicked` listener in `background.js` to contain the following:

```
chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(aTab) {
 chrome.tabs.query({'url': 'http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/'}, (tabs) => {
 if (tabs.length === 0) {
 // There is no catgif tab!
 chrome.tabs.create({'url': 'http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/', 'active': true});
 } else {
 // Do something hereâ€¦
 }
 });
});
```

Huh, that's weird, it's always creating a new tab, no matter how many catgifs tabs there are already... It turns out that our add-on doesn't have permission to see the urls for existing tabs yet which is why it can't find them, so let's go ahead and add that by inserting the following code above the `browser_action`:

```
 "permissions": [
 "tabs"
 ],
```

Once your code looks [similar to this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-5 "Step Five"), re-run `gulp` to rebuild the add-on, and drag-and-drop to install it, and then when we test it out, ta-da! Only one catgif tab! Of course, if we're on another tab it doesn't do anything, so let's fix that. We can change the `else` block to contain the following:

```
 // Do something hereâ€¦
 chrome.tabs.query({'url': 'http://chilloutandwatchsomecatgifs.com/', 'active': true}, (active) => {
 if (active.length === 0) {
 chrome.tabs.update(tabs[0].id, {'active': true});
 }
 });
```

Make sure it looks [like this](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-6 "Step Six"), rebuild, re-install, and shazam, it works!

## Making it look nice

Well, it works, but it's not really pretty. Let's do a couple of things to fix that a bit.

First of all, we can add a custom icon so that our add-on doesn't look like all the other add-ons that haven't bothered to set their icons... To do that, we add the following to `manifest.json` after the `manifest_version` line:

```
 "icons": {
 "48": "icon.png",
 "128": "icon128.png"
 },
```

And, of course, we'll need to download a pretty picture for our icon, so let's save a copy of [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/master/icon.png "icon.png") as `icon.png`, and [this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/master/icon128.png "icon128.png") as `icon128.png`.

We should also have a prettier icon for the button, so going back to the `manifest.json`, let's add the following lines in the `browser_action` block before the `default_title`:

```
 "default_icon": {
 "19": "button.png",
 "38": "button38.png"
 },
```

and save [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/master/button.png "button.png") as `button.png`, and [this image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/master/button38.png "button38.png") as `button38.png`.

Finally, we need to tell our build script about the new files, so change the `files` line of our `gulpfile.js` to:

```
var files = ['manifest.json', 'background.js', '*.png'];
```

Re-run the build, and re-install the add-on, and [we're done](https://github.com/bwinton/catgif-extension/releases/tag/step-7 "Step Seven")! ðŸ˜€

## One more thing...

Well, there is another thing we could try to do. I mean, we have an add-on that works beautifully in Firefox, but one of the advantages of the new WebExtension API is that you can run the same add-on (or an add-on with minimal changes) on both Firefox and Chrome. So let's see what it will take to get this running in both browsers!

We'll start by launching Chrome, and trying to load the add-on, and see what errors it gives us. To load our extension, we'll need to go to `chrome://extensions/`, and check the `Developer mode` checkbox, as shown below:

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/9-ChromeDeveloper-500x315.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/9-ChromeDeveloper-250x158.png%20250w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29297" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/9-ChromeDeveloper.png)

Then we can click the "Load unpacked extension..." button, and choose our directory to load our add-on! Uh-oh, it looks like we've got an error.

[<embed src="https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/10-ChromeAlmost-500x315.png%20500w,%20https://hacks.mozilla.org/files/2015/09/10-ChromeAlmost-250x158.png%20250w" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-29298" width="500">](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/10-ChromeAlmost.png)

Since the `applications` key is required for Firefox, I think we can safely ignore this error. And anyways, the button shows up! And when we click it...

[![Cats!](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/11-ChromeCats.gif)](https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/09/11-ChromeCats.gif)

So, I guess we're done! (I used to have a section in here about how to load [babel.js](https://babeljs.io/ "Babel!"), because the version of Chrome I was using didn't support ES6's [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions "a.k.a. Fat-Arrows."), but apparently they've upgraded their JavaScript engine, and now everything is good. ðŸ˜‰)
