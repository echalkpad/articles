FLVIZ stands for "Formal Languages Visualizer". It is a Windows GUI program which reads a configuration file, and based on its content creates a visualization of a state machine (graph), and lets you apply a stimulus (vocabulary) and see the state transitions happen dynamically.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#introduction)Introduction

It was originally written in 2009 during my "Formal Languages" class which was a part of my M.Sc CS curriculum. The biggest challenge was getting it on time and making it work under Windows, since it was written in about 3 days on FreeBSD and then quickly ported. You can see what I mean if you glance at the `release` directory.

Created for Windows XP with SP 3 and based on QT Creator and `QT4` library, it hasn't been build/used since I finished the class. In 2015 I have updated it: by using <http://www.appveyor.com> I converted it to `Qt5` library and made it work on Windows Server 2012.

During "Formal languages" class we were provided the state machine input file. The format isn't something I designed and is very imperfect.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#requirements)Requirements

- Windows system. Originally XP, then ported to Windows Server 2012\. I suspect any decent Windows version should be fine.
- Qt Creator (tested with Qt 5.5)
- MinGW GCC (installation as a part of Qt)

  - I haven't tested building it with Microsoft Visual C++

All libraries are present in the repo, so deployment straight after compilation should be possible.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#build-instructions)Build instructions

For convenience, build script `build.bat` is present in the repository. To build, run:

```
build.bat
```

Please note this script may need to be adjusted if you end up building with anything else but Qt 5.5.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#convenience-tools-for-appveyor)Convenience tools for AppVeyor

If you clone the repository and also decide to use Appveyor for remote testing/work, you may want to run:

```
gettools.bat
```

Which will install both Vim editor and ConEmu, which are convenience tools for development.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#data-format)Data format

Data format was provided in a class. It's not great. Sample data format is as follows:

```
 filename line data
---------------------------------------------------------
data.1.txt | 1 | 5 3 2
data.1.txt | 2 |
data.1.txt | 3 | <tablica wejsciowa ASD>
data.1.txt | 4 | 0 1 e
data.1.txt | 5 | 1 f f 2
data.1.txt | 6 | 2 3 f f
data.1.txt | 7 | 3 f f 2
data.1.txt | 8 | 4 f 5 f
data.1.txt | 9 | 5 f f f
data.1.txt | 10 |
data.1.txt | 11 | <tablica stanow koncowych>
data.1.txt | 12 | 3 4
```

Empty spaces or lines don't matter. For convenience of discussion, I'm mentioning line numbers for reference below. `f` means empty state.

TODO: understand state indexing. My original comment stated states are indexed from 0, which I believe referred to the implementation.

## [](https://github.com/wkoszek/flviz#data-format-explanation)Data format explanation

- Line (1), intro:

  - 5 states
  - 3 letters in the alphabet
  - 2 end states

- Line (3), magic pragmas:

  - `<tablica wejsciowa ASD>` dla automatu ASD
  - `<tablica wejsciowa ASN>` dla automatu ASN
  - **TODO**: I don't remember what these were all about.

- Line (4):

  - Alphabet available to this program

- Lines (5â€“9):

  - first column means state name, if I'm not mistaken
  - consecutive columns define transitions if one of the alphabet inputs is applied.
  - **TODO**: example needed. Must confirm.

- Line (11), magic pragma:
