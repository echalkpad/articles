HAProxy-SRV is a templating solution that can flexibly reconfigure HAProxy based on the regular polling of the service data from DNS (e.g. SkyDNS or Mesos-DNS) using SRV records.

It has a very simple logic - HA Proxy is configured based on the Handlebars template that is re-evaluated every time changes in DNS are detecting. Script is polling DNS and trigger a HA Proxy configuration refresh after changes.

Made by [elastic.io](http://www.elastic.io) in Germany.

Script works very simple - after docker container started script parse and validates template, create a HAProxy configuration file in `/src/haproxy.cfg` and start HAProxy as a daemon. Every second (by default, can be configured via `REFRESH_TIMEOUT` env variable, default 1000) scirpt will execute a DNS lookup and re-evaluate the template, if result of evaluation is different from original configuration, original config will be overwritten and HAProxy reload will be triggered. HAProxy reload will not affect existing connections.

Recommended way to deploy is is to use [a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/elasticio/haproxy-srv/). You would need to place your configuration file template, the simples way to do it is to build an image based on `haproxy-srv` image.

Create a new `Dockerfile` content like this:

```
FROM elasticio/haproxy-srv:latest

COPY haproxy.cfg.template /src/

EXPOSE 80 8880
```

Note the `EXPOSE` part here, don't forget to specify exposed ports if your HAProxy configuration listens on any port different from `80`.

As a next step create a template file, it should be placed under `/src/haproxy.cfg.template` in resulting Docker container and should have a [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) syntax with one little extension (see below). Here is the sample:

```
global
 user root
 group root

 # Default SSL material locations
 ca-base /etc/ssl/certs
 crt-base /etc/ssl/private

 # Default ciphers to use on SSL-enabled listening sockets.
 # For more information, see ciphers(1SSL).
 ssl-default-bind-ciphers kEECDH+aRSA+AES:kRSA+AES:+AES256:RC4-SHA:!kEDH:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:!aNULL:!eNULL

 # Stats required for this module to work
 # https://github.com/observing/haproxy#haproxycfg
 stats socket /tmp/haproxy.sock level admin

defaults
 mode http
 timeout connect 5000
 timeout client 50000
 timeout server 50000


frontend stats
 bind 0.0.0.0:8081
 mode http
 stats enable
 stats hide-version
 stats uri /

{{#dns-srv "_frontend._tcp.marathon.mesos"}}
 frontend sample
 bind 0.0.0.0:8080
 mode http
 balance roundrobin
 option http-server-close
 option forwardfor
 {{#each this}}
 server frontend-{{@index}} {{ip}}:{{port}} check weight {{weight}}
 {{/each}}
{{/dns-srv}}
```

It could be any valid HAProxy configuration with one mandatory addition:

```
stats socket /tmp/haproxy.sock level admin
```

to trigger HAProxy restart the script inside the file will communicate with HAProxy daemon via socket `/tmp/haproxy.sock`.

## [](https://github.com/elasticio/haproxy-srv#template)Template

Configuration template is a normal [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) so that you could use any of the feature of this template language. There is however one additional helper `dns-srv` implemented. This helper takes one string parameter and will execute a [DNS SRV lookup](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns_dns_resolvesrv_hostname_callback) to fetch an SRV record(s). After SRV Record lookup, for each SRV record a [DNS resolution](https://nodejs.org/api/dns.html#dns_dns_resolve_hostname_rrtype_callback) to find the IP will be made.

This template will give you an idea how to use it:

```
# Your usual configuration is here
{{#dns-srv "_frontend._tcp.marathon.mesos"}}
 # This block will only be rendered when _frontend._tcp.marathon.mesos was found in DNS
 {{#each this}}
 # This piece will be rendered for each SRV entry from DNS
 SRV Name is {{name}}
 SRV Weight is {{weight}}
 SRV Port is {{port}}
 IP for SRV Name is {{ip}}
 {{/each}}
{{/dns-srv}}
# rest of your configuration
```

Typical use-case for Msos-DNS you can see above.
