GHFS mounts to a directory using FUSE and serves contents of GitHub repos on-demand.

Let's try an example. First, generate a GitHub personal access token [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens) â€“ it only needs the `public_repo` scope.

```
$ mkdir /github
$ go run main.go -token=$GITHUB_TOKEN -mountpoint=/github
2015/09/17 04:27:35 serving...
```

While that runs, in another terminal, list repos owned by a user or organization:

```
$ ls /github/golang/
appengine
arch
benchmarks
blog
...
```

You can inspect a repo's branches and tags as subdirectories of the repo:

```
$ ls /github/golang/go
...
master
...
```

And you can inspect the directories and files in the repo at those branches or tags:

```
$ ls /github/golang/go/master
AUTHORS
CONTRIBUTING.md
CONTRIBUTORS
LICENSE
...
```

If you know the specific revision you want to explore, you can use that instead of a branch or tag name:

```
$ ls /github/golang/go/3d1f8c237956ca657b9517040a7431e87f9d8a18
AUTHORS
CONTRIBUTING.md
CONTRIBUTORS
LICENSE
...
```

Or use any unique prefix of the revision SHA:

```
$ ls /github/golang/go/3d1f8c23
```

At a revision/branch/tag, you can explore the repo and read files:

```
$ cat /github/golang/go/master/src/bytes/bytes.go

// Use of this source code is governed by a BSD-style

package bytes

import (
 "unicode"
 "unicode/utf8"
)
...

$ wc -l /github/golang/go/master/src/bytes/bytes.go
 714 /github/golang/go/master/src/bytes/bytes.go

$ grep -n TODO /github/golang/go/master/src/bytes/bytes.go

- **This is a toy**, and is not intended for anything like production use.
- The GitHub API is rate-limited, and this makes a lot of API calls. Don't be surprised if things start to fall apart under load.
- I'm not responsible for this somehow breaking free and ruining your garden party.
