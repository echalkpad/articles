Overcast is a simple terminal-based cloud management tool that was designed to make it easy to spin up and manage clusters of servers in a consistent, scriptable way. Inspired by [Packer.io](http://packer.io).

## [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#concepts)Concepts

1. **Instances** are any machine you can SSH into. Instances can be local or remote, virtual or physical. Each instance has a name, IP, SSH key and port.
2. **Clusters** are sets of instances.

## [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#features)Features

- Define clusters using the command line or manually by editing a JSON file.

  ```
  $ overcast cluster create db
  $ overcast cluster create app
  ```

- Spin up new instances on DigitalOcean. Once finished these are automatically added to clusters.

  ```
  $ overcast instance create db.01 --cluster=db --host=digitalocean
  $ overcast instance create db.02 --cluster=db --host=digitalocean
  ```

- Import existing instances located anywhere to a cluster.

  ```
  $ overcast instance import app.01 --cluster=app --ip=127.0.0.2 \
   --ssh-port=22222 --ssh-key=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
  $ overcast instance import app.02 --cluster=app --ip=127.0.0.3 \
   --ssh-port=22222 --ssh-key=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
  ```

- Run commands or script files on an instance, a cluster, or all clusters, sequentially or in parallel.

  ```
  $ overcast run db install/core install/redis
  $ overcast run all uptime "free-m" "df -h" --parallel
  ```

- Push and pull files between your local machine and an instance, a cluster, or all clusters. Dynamically rewrite file paths to include the instance name.

  ```
  $ overcast push app nginx/myapp.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myapp.conf
  $ overcast pull all /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myapp.conf nginx/{instance}.myapp.conf
  ```

- Overcast is a thin wrapper around your native SSH client, and doesn't install or leave anything on the servers you communicate with.

- A script library is included to make it easy to install common software components in a modular fashion. The library is tailored to Ubuntu 12.04, but could easily be extended to include other distributions/versions.

## [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#design-goals--motivation)Design Goals & Motivation

There are a number of server management frameworks out there already (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Salt), but all involve either a complicated server/client implementation, a steep learning curve or a giant, monolithic conceptual framework.

I wanted something that is conceptually simple and easy to use, that is only concerned with programmatic communication with clusters of servers, that leaves problems like process/state management and monitoring to other tools.

## [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#installation)Installation

1. Install [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager) if not already installed.

2. Install Overcast using npm.

  ```
  $ npm -g install overcast
  ```

3. You can now use Overcast from any directory.

## [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#configuration)Configuration

Overcast looks for an `.overcast` directory in the current directory, or in some parent directory, otherwise falling back to `$HOME/.overcast`. This allows you to have multiple configurations, and to check your cluster definitions and scripts into a repo, like source code.

The command `overcast init` will create a new configuration in the current directory. The config directory looks like this:

```
.overcast
 /files # Files to be copied to instances
 /keys # SSH keys. Can be your own or auto-generated by overcast
 /scripts # Scripts to be run on instances
 /clusters.json # Cluster/instance definitions (see example.clusters.json)
 /variables.json # API keys, etc (see example.variables.json)
```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-cluster)overcast cluster

```
 overcast cluster create [name]
 Creates a new cluster.

 Example:
 $ overcast cluster create db

 overcast cluster rename [name] [new-name]
 Renames a cluster.

 Example:
 $ overcast cluster rename app-cluster app-cluster-old

 overcast cluster remove [name]
 Removes a cluster from the index. If the cluster has any instances
 attached to it, they will be moved to the "orphaned" cluster.

 Example:
 $ overcast cluster remove db
```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-expose)overcast expose

```
 overcast expose [instance|cluster|all] [port...]
 Reset the exposed ports on the instance or cluster using iptables.
 This will fail if you don't include the current SSH port.
 Expects an Ubuntu server, untested on other distributions.

 Examples:
 $ overcast expose redis 22 6379
 $ overcast expose mysql 22 3306
 $ overcast expose app 22 80 443
```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-exposed)overcast exposed

```
 overcast exposed [instance|cluster|all]
 List the exposed ports on the instance or cluster.
 Expects an Ubuntu server, untested on other distributions.

```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-init)overcast init

```
 overcast init
 Create an .overcast config directory in the current working directory.
 No action taken if one already exists.
```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-instance)overcast instance

```
 overcast instance create [name] [options]
 Creates a new instance on a hosting provider. You'll need to add your API
 credentials to the .overcast/variables.json file for this to work.
 See the .overcast/example.variables.json file for reference.

 The instance will start out using the auto-generated SSH key found here:
 /path/to/.overcast/keys/overcast.key.pub

 Option | Default
 --cluster=CLUSTER |
 --provider=NAME | digitalocean
 --region=NAME | nyc2
 --image=NAME | ubuntu-12-04-x64
 --size=NAME | 512mb

 Example:
 $ overcast instance create db.01 --cluster=db --host=digitalocean

 overcast instance import [name] [options]
 Imports an existing instance to a cluster.

 Option | Default
 --cluster=CLUSTER |
 --ip=IP |
 --ssh-port=PORT | 22
 --ssh-key=PATH | .overcast/keys/overcast.key
 --user=USERNAME | root

 Example:
 $ overcast instance import app.01 --cluster=app --ip=127.0.0.1 \
 --ssh-port=22222 --ssh-key=$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa

 overcast instance remove [name]
 Removes an instance from the index.
 The server itself is not affected by this action.

 Example:
 $ overcast instance remove app.01
```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-list)overcast list

```
 overcast list
 Short list of your cluster and instance definitions, stored here:
 /path/to/.overcast/clusters.json

```

### [](https://github.com/andrewchilds/overcast#overcast-port)overcast port

```
 overcast port [instance|cluster|all] [port]
 Change the SSH port for an instance or a cluster.
 Careful, this port should already be open!

 Examples:
 $ overcast port app.01 22222
 $ overcast port db 22222
```

 Destination can be absolute or relative to the .overcast/files directory.

 Any reference to {instance} in the destination will be replaced with the instance name.

 Example:
 Assuming instances "app.01" and "app.02", this will expand to:
 - .overcast/files/nginx/app.01.myapp.conf
 - .overcast/files/nginx/app.02.myapp.conf
 $ overcast pull app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/myapp.conf nginx/{instance}.myapp.conf
```
