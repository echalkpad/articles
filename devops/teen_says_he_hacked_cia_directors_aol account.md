[Hillary Rodham Clinton](http://nypost.com/tag/hillary-clinton/)'s email scandal didn't stop the head of the CIA from using his own personal AOL account to stash work-related documents, according to a high school student who claims to have hacked into them.

CIA Director [John Brennan](http://nypost.com/tag/John-Brennan/)'s private account held sensitive files -- including his 47-page application for top-secret security clearance -- until he recently learned that it had been infiltrated, the hacker told The Post.

Other emails stored in Brennan's non-government account contained the Social Security numbers and personal information of more than a dozen top American intelligence officials, as well as a government letter about the use of "harsh interrogation techniques" on terrorism suspects, according to the hacker.

The FBI and other federal agencies are now investigating the hacker, with one source saying criminal charges are possible, law enforcement sources said.

"I think they'll want to make an example out of him to deter people from doing this in the future," said a source who described the situation as "just wild" and "crazy."

"I can't believe he did this to the head of the CIA,'' the source added. "[The] problem with these older-generation guys is that they don't know anything about cybersecurity, and as you can see, it can be problematic."

In a series of phone conversations with The Post, the hacker described himself as an American high school student who is not Muslim and was motivated by opposition to US foreign policy and support for Palestine.

He wouldn't reveal his name or say where he lived but made good on a promise to tweet "CWA owns John Brennan of the CIA" as a means of verifying his control over the [@phphax](https://twitter.com/phphax) Twitter account.

He explained "CWA" stood for "Crackas With Attitude," which he said referred to him and a classmate.

The hacker contacted The Post last week to brag about his exploits, which include posting some of the stolen documents and a portion of Brennan's contact list on Twitter. The hacker's Twitter page includes the Muslim Shahada creed, which translates as, "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."

He said the stolen documents were stored as attachments to about 40 emails that he read after breaking into Brennan's account on Oct. 12, more than six months after the controversy erupted over Clinton's use of a private computer server to handle emails while serving as secretary of state.

The hacker said he used a tactic called "social engineering" that involved tricking workers at Verizon into providing Brennan's personal information and duping AOL into resetting his password.

Brennan's account was disabled as of Friday, he said.

He claimed he has repeatedly prank-called America's top spy since August, once reciting Brennan's Social Security number to him.

"He waited a tiny bit and hung up," the hacker said.

And he also got into the online Comcast account of Homeland Security Secretary [Jeh Johnson](http://nypost.com/tag/Jeh-Johnson/) and posted a redacted screenshot of a billing page. He claimed that he listened to Johnson's voicemails.

In a statement, the CIA said: "We are aware of the reports that have surfaced on social media and have referred the matter to the appropriate authorities."
