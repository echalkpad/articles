## What is Netflow?

Netflow is a network analysis protocol that was initially created by Cisco to give the ability to collect detailled informations about network traffic as it flows through a router interface.

The data processed by Netflow collectors provides the network administrator with detailled traffic informations such as the source and destination of the traffic, class of service, .... Netflow version 9 was standardized in 2008 as IPFIX by the IETF organization. This feature is used by network operators for billing network users.

NetFlow records are exported to a Netflow collector using User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The IP address and the destination UDP port of the NetFlow collector have to be configured on the sending device (router or l3 switch). The standard value is UDP port 2055, but other values like 9555 or 9995 can also be used.

## Netflow in Packet Tracer 6.1

The following Netflow components are available in Packet Tracer 6.1.1 :

- Netflow version 9 on Cisco ISR routers. This feature is not available on Layer 3 switches.
- A netflow collector software on PC, laptop and server devices.

## Netflow configuration using Cisco 2811 ISR routers

### Network topology and configuration instructions**

**

**![]()**

**IP configuration :**

- IP Phone n째1 : 192.168.10.2/24
- IP Phone n째2 : 192.168.10.4/24
- Router Fa0/0 : 192.168.10.1/24
- Router Fa0/1 : 192.168.20.1/24
- Netflow Collector : 192.168.20.2/24

**First step** : Configure netflow collection on router interfaces using the "ip flow" IOS command. The flow can be configured on either ingress or egress direction. It is recommended to configure the flow on ingress.

```
interface FastEthernet0/0
 ip flow ingress
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 duplex auto
 speed auto
```

**Second step** : Configure the ISR router to send the flow records to the netflow collector. Packet Tracer 6.1 netflow collection software deployed on end devices (servers or PCs) uses UDP port 9996.

```
ip flow-export destination 192.168.20.2 9996
ip flow-export version 9
```

### Testing the configuration

Make a phone call from IP Phone n째1 to IP Phone n째2 and use the "**show ip cache flow**" command on the ISR router to display the router's netflow cache. In this example, the router shows a SCCP (TCP-SKINNY) flow between the two IP Phones (192.168.10.2 & 192.168.10.4).

```
