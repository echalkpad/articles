A **computer network** or **data network** is a [telecommunications network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network "Telecommunications network") which allows [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") to exchange [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computing) "Data (computing)"). In computer networks, networked computing devices exchange data with each other using a [data link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link "Data link"). The connections between nodes are established using either [cable media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_line "Transmission line") or [wireless media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network "Wireless network"). The best-known computer network is the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called [network nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)").

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-1">[1]</a>
</sup>

 Nodes can include [hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network) "Host (network)") such as [personal computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), [phones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phone "Phone"), [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)") as well as [networking hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware "Networking hardware"). Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other.

Computer networks differ in the [transmission medium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_medium "Transmission medium") used to carry their signals, the [communications protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") to organize network traffic, the network's size, [topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology "Network topology") and organizational intent.

Computer networks support an enormous number of [applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software "Application software") such as access to the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web "World Wide Web"), [video](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video "Video"), [digital audio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio "Digital audio"), shared use of [application and storage servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_server "File server"), [printers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing "Printing"), and fax machines, and use of [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email") and [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging "Instant messaging") applications as well as many others. In most cases, application-specific communications protocols are [layered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol#Layering "Communications protocol") (i.e. carried as [payload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing) "Payload (computing)")) over other more general communications protocols.

Computer networking may be considered a branch of [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [telecommunications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications "Telecommunications"), [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology "Information technology") or [computer engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_engineering "Computer engineering"), since it relies upon the theoretical and practical application of the related disciplines.

A computer network facilitates interpersonal communications allowing users to communicate efficiently and easily via various means: email, instant messaging, chat rooms, telephone, video telephone calls, and video conferencing. Providing access to information on shared storage devices is an important feature of many networks. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer. [Distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing "Distributed computing") uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks. A computer network may be used by [computer crackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracker_(computer_security) "Cracker (computer security)") to deploy [computer viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus "Computer virus") or [computer worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm "Computer worm") on devices connected to the network, or to prevent these devices from accessing the network via a [denial of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack "Denial-of-service attack") attack.

Main article: [Network packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet")

Computer communication links that do not support packets, such as traditional [point-to-point telecommunication links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-to-point_link "Point-to-point link"), simply transmit data as a [bit stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_stream "Bit stream"). However, most information in computer networks is carried in _packets_. A network packet is a formatted unit of [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") (a list of bits or bytes, usually a few tens of bytes to a few kilobytes long) carried by a [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network "Packet-switched network").

In packet networks, the data is formatted into packets that are sent through the network to their destination. Once the packets arrive they are reassembled into their original message. With packets, the [bandwidth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing) "Bandwidth (computing)") of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were [circuit switched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching "Circuit switching"). When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from others users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused.

Packets consist of two kinds of data: control information, and user data(payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example: source and destination [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address"), [error detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection "Error detection") codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in [packet headers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Header_(computing) "Header (computing)") and [trailers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(computing) "Trailer (computing)"), with [payload data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing) "Payload (computing)") in between.

Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case the packet is [queued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue "Message queue") and waits until a link is free.

Main article: [Network topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology "Network topology")

The physical layout of a network is usually less important than the topology that connects network nodes. Most diagrams that describe a physical network are therefore topological, rather than geographic. The symbols on these diagrams usually denote network links and network nodes.

The transmission media (often referred to in the literature as the _physical media_) used to link devices to form a computer network include [electrical cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable "Cable") ([Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), [HomePNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomePNA "HomePNA"), [power line communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication "Power line communication"), [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn "G.hn")), [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber "Optical fiber") ([fiber-optic communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber-optic_communication "Fiber-optic communication")), and [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves") ([wireless networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_networking "Wireless networking")). In the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model"), these are defined at layers 1 and 2 -- the physical layer and the data link layer.

A widely adopted _family_ of transmission media used in local area network ([LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAN "LAN")) technology is collectively known as [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"). The media and protocol standards that enable communication between networked devices over Ethernet are defined by [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3 "IEEE 802.3"). Ethernet transmits data over both copper and fiber cables. Wireless LAN standards (e.g. those defined by [IEEE 802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11 "IEEE 802.11")) use [radio waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_waves "Radio waves"), or others use [infrared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IrDA "IrDA") signals as a transmission medium. [Power line communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication "Power line communication") uses a building's power cabling to transmit data.

The orders of the following wired technologies are, roughly, from slowest to fastest transmission speed.

- _[Coaxial cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coaxial_cable "Coaxial cable")_ is widely used for cable television systems, office buildings, and other work-sites for local area networks. The cables consist of copper or aluminum wire surrounded by an insulating layer (typically a flexible material with a high dielectric constant), which itself is surrounded by a conductive layer. The insulation helps minimize interference and distortion. Transmission speed ranges from 200 million bits per second to more than 500 million bits per second.
- [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T "ITU-T") [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn "G.hn") technology uses existing [home wiring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_wiring "Home wiring") ([coaxial cable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_coax "Ethernet over coax"), phone lines and [power lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_line_communication "Power line communication")) to create a high-speed (up to 1 Gigabit/s) local area network
- _[Twisted pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair "Twisted pair") wire_ is the most widely used medium for all telecommunication. Twisted-pair cabling consist of copper wires that are twisted into pairs. Ordinary telephone wires consist of two insulated copper wires twisted into pairs. Computer network cabling (wired [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") as defined by [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3 "IEEE 802.3")) consists of 4 pairs of copper cabling that can be utilized for both voice and data transmission. The use of two wires twisted together helps to reduce [crosstalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crosstalk_(electronics) "Crosstalk (electronics)") and [electromagnetic induction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_induction "Electromagnetic induction"). The transmission speed ranges from 2 million bits per second to 10 billion bits per second. Twisted pair cabling comes in two forms: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted-pair (STP). Each form comes in several category ratings, designed for use in various scenarios.

- An _[optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber "Optical fiber")_ is a glass fiber. It carries pulses of light that represent data. Some advantages of optical fibers over metal wires are very low transmission loss and immunity from electrical interference. Optical fibers can simultaneously carry multiple wavelengths of light, which greatly increases the rate that data can be sent, and helps enable data rates of up to trillions of bits per second. Optic fibers can be used for long runs of cable carrying very high data rates, and are used for [undersea cables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undersea_cables "Undersea cables") to interconnect continents.

Price is a main factor distinguishing wired- and wireless-technology options in a business. Wireless options command a price premium that can make purchasing wired computers, printers and other devices a financial benefit. Before making the decision to purchase hard-wired technology products, a review of the restrictions and limitations of the selections is necessary. Business and employee needs may override any cost considerations.

Computers are very often connected to networks using wireless links

Main article: [Wireless network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network "Wireless network")

- _Terrestrial [microwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave "Microwave")_ – Terrestrial microwave communication uses Earth-based transmitters and receivers resembling satellite dishes. Terrestrial microwaves are in the low-gigahertz range, which limits all communications to line-of-sight. Relay stations are spaced approximately 48 km (30 mi) apart.
- _Communications [satellites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite "Satellite")_ – Satellites communicate via microwave radio waves, which are not deflected by the Earth's atmosphere. The satellites are stationed in space, typically in geosynchronous orbit 35,400 km (22,000 mi) above the equator. These Earth-orbiting systems are capable of receiving and relaying voice, data, and TV signals.
- _[Cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network "Cellular network") and PCS systems_ use several radio communications technologies. The systems divide the region covered into multiple geographic areas. Each area has a low-power transmitter or radio relay antenna device to relay calls from one area to the next area.
- _Radio and [spread spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread_spectrum "Spread spectrum") technologies_ – Wireless local area networks use a high-frequency radio technology similar to digital cellular and a low-frequency radio technology. Wireless LANs use spread spectrum technology to enable communication between multiple devices in a limited area. [IEEE 802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11 "IEEE 802.11") defines a common flavor of open-standards wireless radio-wave technology known as [Wifi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wifi "Wifi").
- _[Free-space optical communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication "Free-space optical communication")_ uses visible or invisible light for communications. In most cases, [line-of-sight propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation "Line-of-sight propagation") is used, which limits the physical positioning of communicating devices.

An [ATM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode "Asynchronous Transfer Mode") network interface in the form of an accessory card. A lot of network interfaces are built-in.

A [network interface controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller "Network interface controller") (NIC) is [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware "Computer hardware") that provides a computer with the ability to access the transmission media, and has the ability to process low-level network information. For example, the NIC may have a connector for accepting a cable, or an aerial for wireless transmission and reception, and the associated circuitry.

The NIC responds to traffic addressed to a [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address") for either the NIC or the computer as a whole.

In [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") networks, each network interface controller has a unique [Media Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address "MAC address") (MAC) address--usually stored in the controller's permanent memory. To avoid address conflicts between network devices, the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_Electrical_and_Electronics_Engineers "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers") (IEEE) maintains and administers MAC address uniqueness. The size of an Ethernet MAC address is six [octets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octet_(computing) "Octet (computing)"). The three most significant octets are reserved to identify NIC manufacturers. These manufacturers, using only their assigned prefixes, uniquely assign the three least-significant octets of every Ethernet interface they produce.

</span>

A [repeater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater "Repeater") is an [electronic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronics "Electronics") device that receives a network [signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory) "Signal (information theory)"), cleans it of unnecessary noise and regenerates it. The signal is [retransmitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks) "Retransmission (data networks)") at a higher power level, or to the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances without degradation. In most twisted pair Ethernet configurations, repeaters are required for cable that runs longer than 100 meters. With fiber optics, repeaters can be tens or even hundreds of kilometers apart.

A repeater with multiple ports is known as a [hub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_hub "Network hub"). Repeaters work on the physical layer of the OSI model. Repeaters require a small amount of time to regenerate the signal. This can cause a [propagation delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_delay "Propagation delay") that affects network performance. As a result, many network architectures limit the number of repeaters that can be used in a row, e.g., the Ethernet [5-4-3 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5-4-3_rule "5-4-3 rule").

Hubs have been mostly obsoleted by modern [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch "Network switch"); but repeaters are used for long distance links, notably undersea cabling.

  <span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span>
</span>

A [network bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge "Network bridge") connects and filters traffic between two [network segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_segment "Network segment") at the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer") (layer 2) of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model") to form a single network. This breaks the network's collision domain but maintains a unified broadcast domain. Network segmentation breaks down a large, congested network into an aggregation of smaller, more efficient networks.

Bridges come in three basic types:

- Local bridges: Directly connect LANs
- Remote bridges: Can be used to create a wide area network (WAN) link between LANs. Remote bridges, where the connecting link is slower than the end networks, largely have been replaced with routers.
- Wireless bridges: Can be used to join LANs or connect remote devices to LANs.

</span>

A [network switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch "Network switch") is a device that forwards and filters [OSI layer 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_layer_2 "OSI layer 2") [datagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagram "Datagram") ([frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_(networking) "Frame (networking)")) between [ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(hardware) "Computer port (hardware)") based on the destination MAC address in each frame.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-9">[9]</a>
</sup>

 A switch is distinct from a hub in that it only forwards the frames to the physical ports involved in the communication rather than all ports connected. It can be thought of as a multi-port bridge.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-10">[10]</a>
</sup>

 It learns to associate physical ports to MAC addresses by examining the source addresses of received frames. If an unknown destination is targeted, the switch broadcasts to all ports but the source. Switches normally have numerous ports, facilitating a star topology for devices, and cascading additional switches.

[Multi-layer switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch#Layer-specific_functionality "Network switch") are capable of routing based on layer 3 addressing or additional logical levels. The term _switch_ is often used loosely to include devices such as routers and bridges, as well as devices that may distribute traffic based on load or based on application content (e.g., a Web [URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator "Uniform Resource Locator") identifier).

A [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)") is an [internetworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetworking "Internetworking") device that forwards [packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_(information_technology) "Packet (information technology)") between networks by processing the routing information included in the packet or datagram (Internet protocol information from layer 3). The routing information is often processed in conjunction with the routing table (or forwarding table). A router uses its routing table to determine where to forward packets. A destination in a routing table can include a "null" interface, also known as the "black hole" interface because data can go into it, however, no further processing is done for said data, i.e. the packets are dropped.

[Network topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_topology "Network topology") is the layout or organizational hierarchy of interconnected nodes of a computer network. Different network topologies can affect throughput, but reliability is often more critical. With many technologies, such as bus networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.

Common network topologies

Common layouts are:

- A [bus network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_network "Bus network"): all nodes are connected to a common medium along this medium. This was the layout used in the original [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), called [10BASE5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE5 "10BASE5") and [10BASE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10BASE2 "10BASE2").
- A [star network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_network "Star network"): all nodes are connected to a special central node. This is the typical layout found in a [Wireless LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN "Wireless LAN"), where each wireless client connects to the central [Wireless access point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_access_point "Wireless access point").
- A [ring network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_network "Ring network"): each node is connected to its left and right neighbour node, such that all nodes are connected and that each node can reach each other node by traversing nodes left- or rightwards. The [Fiber Distributed Data Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_Distributed_Data_Interface "Fiber Distributed Data Interface") (FDDI) made use of such a topology.
- A [mesh network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_network "Mesh network"): each node is connected to an arbitrary number of neighbours in such a way that there is at least one traversal from any node to any other.
- A [fully connected network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_connected_network "Fully connected network"): each node is connected to every other node in the network.
- A [tree network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_network "Tree network"): nodes are arranged hierarchically.

Note that the physical layout of the nodes in a network may not necessarily reflect the network topology. As an example, with [FDDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDDI "FDDI"), the network topology is a ring (actually two counter-rotating rings), but the physical topology is often a star, because all neighboring connections can be routed via a central physical location.

A sample overlay network

An [overlay network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overlay_network "Overlay network") is a virtual computer network that is built on top of another network. Nodes in the overlay network are connected by virtual or logical links. Each link corresponds to a path, perhaps through many physical links, in the underlying network. The topology of the overlay network may (and often does) differ from that of the underlying one. For example, many [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") networks are overlay networks. They are organized as nodes of a virtual system of links that run on top of the Internet.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-over-11">[11]</a>
</sup>

Overlay networks have been around since the invention of networking when computer systems were connected over telephone lines using [modems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem "Modem"), before any data network existed.

The most striking example of an overlay network is the Internet itself. The Internet itself was initially built as an overlay on the [telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_network "Telephone network").

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-over-11">[11]</a>
</sup>

 Even today, each Internet node can communicate with virtually any other through an underlying mesh of sub-networks of wildly different topologies and technologies. [Address resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol "Address Resolution Protocol") and [routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing") are the means that allow mapping of a fully connected IP overlay network to its underlying network.

Another example of an overlay network is a [distributed hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table "Distributed hash table"), which maps keys to nodes in the network. In this case, the underlying network is an IP network, and the overlay network is a table (actually a [map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array "Associative array")) indexed by keys.

Overlay networks have also been proposed as a way to improve Internet routing, such as through [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") guarantees to achieve higher-quality [streaming media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media"). Previous proposals such as [IntServ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntServ "IntServ"), [DiffServ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiffServ "DiffServ"), and [IP Multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Multicast "IP Multicast") have not seen wide acceptance largely because they require modification of all [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)") in the network.

<sup>[<em>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (August 2010)">citation\ needed</span></a>
</em>]</sup>

 On the other hand, an overlay network can be incrementally deployed on end-hosts running the overlay protocol software, without cooperation from [Internet service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider"). The overlay network has no control over how packets are routed in the underlying network between two overlay nodes, but it can control, for example, the sequence of overlay nodes that a message traverses before it reaches its destination.

For example, [Akamai Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akamai_Technologies "Akamai Technologies") manages an overlay network that provides reliable, efficient content delivery (a kind of [multicast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast "Multicast")). Academic research includes end system multicast,

A [communications protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol "Communications protocol") is a set of rules for exchanging information over network links. In a [protocol stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_stack "Protocol stack") (also see the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model")), each protocol leverages the services of the protocol below it. An important example of a protocol stack is [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") (the [World Wide Web protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WWW "WWW")) running over [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_protocol "Transmission control protocol") over [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol "Internet protocol") (the [Internet protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite "Internet Protocol Suite")) over [IEEE 802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11 "IEEE 802.11") (the Wi-Fi protocol). This stack is used between the [wireless router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router "Wireless router") and the home user's personal computer when the user is surfing the web.

Whilst the use of protocol layering is today ubiquitous across the field of computer networking, it has been historically criticized by many researchers

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-13">[13]</a>
</sup>

 for two principal reasons. Firstly, abstracting the protocol stack in this way may cause a higher layer to duplicate functionality of a lower layer, a prime example being error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-14">[14]</a>
</sup>

 Secondly, it is common that a protocol implementation at one layer may require data, state or addressing information that is only present at another layer, thus defeating the point of separating the layers in the first place. For example, [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_protocol "Transmission control protocol") uses the ECN field in the [IPv4 header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_header "IPv4 header") as an indication of congestion; IP is a [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer "Network layer") protocol whereas TCP is a [transport layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer "Transport layer") protocol.

Communication protocols have various characteristics. They may be [connection-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented_communication "Connection-oriented communication") or [connectionless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectionless_communication "Connectionless communication"), they may use [circuit mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_mode "Circuit mode") or [packet switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching"), and they may use hierarchical addressing or flat addressing.

There are many communication protocols, a few of which are described below.

The complete [IEEE 802](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802 "IEEE 802") protocol suite provides a diverse set of networking capabilities. The protocols have a flat addressing scheme. They operate mostly at levels 1 and 2 of the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model").

For example, [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_access_control "Media access control") [bridging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking) "Bridging (networking)") ([IEEE 802.1D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1D "IEEE 802.1D")) deals with the routing of Ethernet packets using a [Spanning Tree Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol "Spanning Tree Protocol"). [IEEE 802.1Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1Q "IEEE 802.1Q") describes [VLANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN "Virtual LAN"), and [IEEE 802.1X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.1X "IEEE 802.1X") defines a port-based [Network Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Access_Control "Network Access Control") protocol, which forms the basis for the authentication mechanisms used in VLANs (but it is also found in WLANs) – it is what the home user sees when the user has to enter a "wireless access key".

[Synchronous optical networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronous_optical_networking "Synchronous optical networking") (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are standardized [multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing "Multiplexing") protocols that transfer multiple digital bit streams over optical fiber using lasers. They were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications from a variety of different sources, primarily to support real-time, uncompressed, [circuit-switched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching "Circuit switching") voice encoded in [PCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_code_modulation "Pulse code modulation") (Pulse-Code Modulation) format. However, due to its protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH also was the obvious choice for transporting [Asynchronous Transfer Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode "Asynchronous Transfer Mode") (ATM) frames.

</span>

[Asynchronous Transfer Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode "Asynchronous Transfer Mode") (ATM) is a switching technique for telecommunication networks. It uses asynchronous [time-division multiplexing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-division_multiplexing "Time-division multiplexing") and encodes data into small, fixed-sized [cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_relay "Cell relay"). This differs from other protocols such as the [Internet Protocol Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite "Internet Protocol Suite") or [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") that use variable sized packets or [frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_Relay "Frame Relay"). ATM has similarity with both [circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching "Circuit switching") and [packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching "Packet switching") switched networking. This makes it a good choice for a network that must handle both traditional high-throughput data traffic, and real-time, [low-latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Latency (engineering)") content such as voice and video. ATM uses a [connection-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connection-oriented "Connection-oriented") model in which a [virtual circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_circuit "Virtual circuit") must be established between two endpoints before the actual data exchange begins.

While the role of ATM is diminishing in favor of [next-generation networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_generation_network "Next generation network"), it still plays a role in the [last mile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile "Last mile"), which is the connection between an [Internet service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider "Internet service provider") and the home user.

A network can be characterized by its physical capacity or its organizational purpose. Use of the network, including user authorization and access rights, differ accordingly.

Nanoscale network A [nanoscale communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_P1906.1 "IEEE P1906.1") network has key components implemented at the nanoscale including message carriers and leverages physical principles that differ from macroscale communication mechanisms. Nanoscale communication extends communication to very small sensors and actuators such as those found in biological systems and also tends to operate in environments that would be too harsh for classical communication.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-16">[16]</a>
</sup>

Personal area network A [personal area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_area_network "Personal area network") (PAN) is a computer network used for communication among computer and different information technological devices close to one person. Some examples of devices that are used in a PAN are personal computers, printers, fax machines, telephones, PDAs, scanners, and even video game consoles. A PAN may include wired and wireless devices. The reach of a PAN typically extends to 10 meters.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-17">[17]</a>
</sup>

 A wired PAN is usually constructed with USB and FireWire connections while technologies such as Bluetooth and infrared communication typically form a wireless PAN.

Local area network A [local area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") (LAN) is a network that connects computers and devices in a limited geographical area such as a home, school, office building, or closely positioned group of buildings. Each computer or device on the network is a [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)"). Wired LANs are most likely based on [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") technology. Newer standards such as [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T "ITU-T") [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn "G.hn") also provide a way to create a wired LAN using existing wiring, such as coaxial cables, telephone lines, and power lines.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-18">[18]</a>
</sup>

The defining characteristics of a LAN, in contrast to a [wide area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network "Wide area network") (WAN), include higher [data transfer rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwidth_(computing) "Bandwidth (computing)"), limited geographic range, and lack of reliance on [leased lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leased_line "Leased line") to provide connectivity. Current Ethernet or other [IEEE 802.3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.3 "IEEE 802.3") LAN technologies operate at data transfer rates up to [100 Gbit/s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_Gigabit_Ethernet "100 Gigabit Ethernet"), standarized by [IEEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE "IEEE") in 2010.

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-19">[19]</a>
</sup>

 Currently, [400 Gbit/s Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terabit_Ethernet "Terabit Ethernet") is being developed.

A LAN can be connected to a WAN using a [router](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)").

Home area network A [home area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_area_network "Home area network") (HAN) is a residential LAN used for communication between digital devices typically deployed in the home, usually a small number of personal computers and accessories, such as printers and mobile computing devices. An important function is the sharing of Internet access, often a broadband service through a cable TV or [digital subscriber line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_subscriber_line "Digital subscriber line") (DSL) provider.

Storage area network A [storage area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_area_network "Storage area network") (SAN) is a dedicated network that provides access to consolidated, block level data storage. SANs are primarily used to make storage devices, such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and optical jukeboxes, accessible to servers so that the devices appear like locally attached devices to the operating system. A SAN typically has its own network of storage devices that are generally not accessible through the local area network by other devices. The cost and complexity of SANs dropped in the early 2000s to levels allowing wider adoption across both enterprise and small to medium-sized business environments.

Campus area network A [campus area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campus_area_network "Campus area network") (CAN) is made up of an interconnection of LANs within a limited geographical area. The networking equipment (switches, routers) and transmission media (optical fiber, copper plant, [Cat5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_5_cable "Category 5 cable") cabling, etc.) are almost entirely owned by the campus tenant / owner (an enterprise, university, government, etc.).

For example, a university campus network is likely to link a variety of campus buildings to connect academic colleges or departments, the library, and student residence halls.

Backbone network A [backbone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network "Backbone network") is part of a computer network infrastructure that provides a path for the exchange of information between different LANs or sub-networks. A backbone can tie together diverse networks within the same building, across different buildings, or over a wide area.

For example, a large company might implement a backbone network to connect departments that are located around the world. The equipment that ties together the departmental networks constitutes the network backbone. When designing a network backbone, [network performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_performance_management "Network performance management") and [network congestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion "Network congestion") are critical factors to take into account. Normally, the backbone network's capacity is greater than that of the individual networks connected to it.

Another example of a backbone network is the [Internet backbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone "Internet backbone"), which is the set of [wide area networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network "Wide area network") (WANs) and [core routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_router "Core router") that tie together all networks connected to the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet").

Metropolitan area network A [Metropolitan area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area_network "Metropolitan area network") (MAN) is a large computer network that usually spans a city or a large campus.

Wide area network A [wide area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network "Wide area network") (WAN) is a computer network that covers a large geographic area such as a city, country, or spans even intercontinental distances. A WAN uses a communications channel that combines many types of media such as telephone lines, cables, and air waves. A WAN often makes use of transmission facilities provided by common carriers, such as telephone companies. WAN technologies generally function at the lower three layers of the [OSI reference model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model "OSI model"): the [physical layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_layer "Physical layer"), the [data link layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_link_layer "Data link layer"), and the [network layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_layer "Network layer").

Enterprise private network An [enterprise private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_private_network "Enterprise private network") is a network that a single organization builds to interconnect its office locations (e.g., production sites, head offices, remote offices, shops) so they can share computer resources.

Virtual private network A [virtual private network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network "Virtual private network") (VPN) is an overlay network in which some of the links between nodes are carried by open connections or virtual circuits in some larger network (e.g., the Internet) instead of by physical wires. The data link layer protocols of the virtual network are said to be tunneled through the larger network when this is the case. One common application is secure communications through the public Internet, but a VPN need not have explicit security features, such as authentication or content encryption. VPNs, for example, can be used to separate the traffic of different user communities over an underlying network with strong security features.

VPN may have best-effort performance, or may have a defined service level agreement (SLA) between the VPN customer and the VPN service provider. Generally, a VPN has a topology more complex than point-to-point.

Global area network A [global area network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_area_network "Global area network") (GAN) is a network used for supporting mobile across an arbitrary number of wireless LANs, satellite coverage areas, etc. The key challenge in mobile communications is handing off user communications from one local coverage area to the next. In IEEE Project 802, this involves a succession of terrestrial [wireless LANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_LAN "Wireless LAN").

Networks are typically managed by the organizations that own them. Private enterprise networks may use a combination of intranets and extranets.

An [intranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet "Intranet") is a set of networks that are under the control of a single administrative entity. The intranet uses the [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") protocol and IP-based tools such as web browsers and file transfer applications. The administrative entity limits use of the intranet to its authorized users. Most commonly, an intranet is the internal LAN of an organization. A large intranet typically has at least one web server to provide users with organizational information. An intranet is also anything behind the router on a local area network.

An [extranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extranet "Extranet") is a network that is also under the administrative control of a single organization, but supports a limited connection to a specific external network.

Routing calculates good paths through a network for information to take. For example, from node 1 to node 6 the best routes are likely to be 1-8-7-6 or 1-8-10-6, as this has the thickest routes.

[Routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing "Routing") is the process of selecting network paths to carry network traffic. Routing is performed for many kinds of networks, including [circuit switching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching "Circuit switching") networks and [packet switched networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switched_network "Packet switched network").

In packet switched networks, routing directs [packet forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_forwarding "Packet forwarding") (the transit of logically addressed [network packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_packet "Network packet") from their source toward their ultimate destination) through intermediate [nodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking) "Node (networking)"). Intermediate nodes are typically network hardware devices such as [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)"), [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking) "Bridging (networking)"), [gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications) "Gateway (telecommunications)"), [firewalls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing) "Firewall (computing)"), or [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch "Network switch"). General-purpose [computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer "Computer") can also forward packets and perform routing, though they are not specialized hardware and may suffer from limited performance. The routing process usually directs forwarding on the basis of [routing tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table "Routing table"), which maintain a record of the routes to various network destinations. Thus, constructing routing tables, which are held in the router's [memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_storage "Computer storage"), is very important for efficient routing.

There are usually multiple routes that can be taken, and to choose between them, different elements can be considered to decide which routes get installed into the routing table, such as (sorted by priority):

1. _Prefix-Length_: where longer subnet masks are preferred (independent if it is within a routing protocol or over different routing protocol)
2. _Metric_: where a lower metric/cost is preferred (only valid within one and the same routing protocol)
3. _[Administrative distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_distance "Administrative distance")_: where a lower distance is preferred (only valid between different routing protocols)

Most routing algorithms use only one network path at a time. [Multipath routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipath_routing "Multipath routing") techniques enable the use of multiple alternative paths.

Routing, in a more narrow sense of the term, is often contrasted with [bridging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking) "Bridging (networking)") in its assumption that [network addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address "Network address") are structured and that similar addresses imply proximity within the network. Structured addresses allow a single routing table entry to represent the route to a group of devices. In large networks, structured addressing (routing, in the narrow sense) outperforms unstructured addressing (bridging). Routing has become the dominant form of addressing on the Internet. Bridging is still widely used within localized environments.

Depending on the installation requirements, [network performance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_performance "Network performance") is usually measured by the [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") of a telecommunications product. The parameters that affect this typically can include [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput"), [jitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter "Jitter"), [bit error rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_error_rate "Bit error rate") and [latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_(engineering) "Latency (engineering)").

The following list gives examples of network performance measures for a circuit-switched network and one type of [packet-switched network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet-switched_network "Packet-switched network"), viz. ATM:

- Circuit-switched networks: In [circuit switched](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switched "Circuit switched") networks, network performance is synonymous with the [grade of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_of_service "Grade of service"). The number of rejected calls is a measure of how well the network is performing under heavy traffic loads.

  <sup>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-26">[26]</a>
  </sup>

   Other types of performance measures can include the level of noise and echo.
- ATM: In an [Asynchronous Transfer Mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Transfer_Mode "Asynchronous Transfer Mode") (ATM) network, performance can be measured by line rate, [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") (QoS), data throughput, connect time, stability, technology, modulation technique and modem enhancements.

  <sup>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-27">[27]</a>
  </sup>

There are many ways to measure the performance of a network, as each network is different in nature and design. Performance can also be modelled instead of measured. For example, [state transition diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_diagram "State diagram") are often used to model queuing performance in a circuit-switched network. The network planner uses these diagrams to analyze how the network performs in each state, ensuring that the network is optimally designed.

### <span id="Network_congestion" class="mw-headline">Network congestion</span>

  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Computer_network&amp;action=edit&amp;section=38" title="Edit section: Network congestion">edit</a>
  <span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span>
</span>

[Network congestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_congestion "Network congestion") occurs when a link or node is carrying so much data that its [quality of service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") deteriorates. Typical effects include [queueing delay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_delay "Queueing delay"), [packet loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_loss "Packet loss") or the [blocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_probability "Blocking probability") of new connections. A consequence of these latter two is that incremental increases in [offered load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offered_load "Offered load") lead either only to small increase in network [throughput](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throughput "Throughput"), or to an actual reduction in network throughput.

[Network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol "Network protocol") that use aggressive [retransmissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retransmission_(data_networks) "Retransmission (data networks)") to compensate for packet loss tend to keep systems in a state of network congestion--even after the initial load is reduced to a level that would not normally induce network congestion. Thus, networks using these protocols can exhibit two stable states under the same level of load. The stable state with low throughput is known as _congestive collapse_.

Modern networks use [congestion control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_control "Congestion control") and [congestion avoidance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_avoidance "Congestion avoidance") techniques to try to avoid congestion collapse. These include: [exponential backoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff "Exponential backoff") in protocols such as [802.11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.11 "802.11")'s [CSMA/CA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier_sense_multiple_access_with_collision_avoidance "Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance") and the original [Ethernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), [window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window "Sliding window") reduction in [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_control_protocol "Transmission control protocol"), and [fair queueing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_queueing "Fair queueing") in devices such as [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)"). Another method to avoid the negative effects of network congestion is implementing priority schemes, so that some packets are transmitted with higher priority than others. Priority schemes do not solve network congestion by themselves, but they help to alleviate the effects of congestion for some services. An example of this is [802.1p](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/802.1p "802.1p"). A third method to avoid network congestion is the explicit allocation of network resources to specific flows. One example of this is the use of Contention-Free Transmission Opportunities (CFTXOPs) in the [ITU-T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T "ITU-T") [G.hn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.hn "G.hn") standard, which provides high-speed (up to 1 Gbit/s) [Local area networking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network "Local area network") over existing home wires (power lines, phone lines and coaxial cables).

For the Internet [RFC 2914](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2914) addresses the subject of congestion control in detail.

[Network surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_surveillance "Network surveillance") is the monitoring of data being transferred over computer networks such as the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet"). The monitoring is often done surreptitiously and may be done by or at the behest of governments, by corporations, criminal organizations, or individuals. It may or may not be legal and may or may not require authorization from a court or other independent agency.

Computer and network surveillance programs are widespread today, and almost all Internet traffic is or could potentially be monitored for clues to illegal activity.

Surveillance is very useful to governments and [law enforcement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement "Law enforcement") to maintain [social control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_control "Social control"), recognize and monitor threats, and prevent/investigate [criminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal "Criminal") activity. With the advent of programs such as the [Total Information Awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness "Total Information Awareness") program, technologies such as [high speed surveillance computers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NarusInsight "NarusInsight") and [biometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance#Biometric "Surveillance") software, and laws such as the [Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Assistance_For_Law_Enforcement_Act "Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act"), governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of citizens.

</span>

[End-to-end encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption "End-to-end encryption") (E2EE) is a [digital communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_communications "Digital communications") paradigm of uninterrupted protection of data traveling between two communicating parties. It involves the originating party [encrypting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption") data so only the intended recipient can decrypt it, with no dependency on third parties. End-to-end encryption prevents intermediaries, such as [Internet providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_providers "Internet providers") or [application service providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_service_provider "Application service provider"), from discovering or tampering with communications. End-to-end encryption generally protects both [confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "Confidentiality") and [integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity").

Examples of end-to-end encryption include [PGP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy "Pretty Good Privacy") for [email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email "Email"), [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging "Off-the-Record Messaging") for [instant messaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging "Instant messaging"), [ZRTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZRTP "ZRTP") for [telephony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephony "Telephony"), and [TETRA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Trunked_Radio "Terrestrial Trunked Radio") for radio.

Typical [server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)")-based communications systems do not include end-to-end encryption. These systems can only guarantee protection of communications between [clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)") and [servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing) "Server (computing)"), not between the communicating parties themselves. Examples of non-E2EE systems are [Google Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Talk "Google Talk"), [Yahoo Messenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo_Messenger "Yahoo Messenger"), [Facebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook "Facebook"), and [Dropbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dropbox_(service) "Dropbox (service)"). Some such systems, for example LavaBit and SecretInk, have even described themselves as offering "end-to-end" encryption when they do not. Some systems that normally offer end-to-end encryption have turned out to contain a [back door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backdoor_(computing) "Backdoor (computing)") that subverts negotiation of the [encryption key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_key "Encryption key") between the communicating parties, for example [Skype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype "Skype") or [Hushmail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hushmail "Hushmail").

The end-to-end encryption paradigm does not directly address risks at the communications endpoints themselves, such as the [technical exploitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security) "Exploit (computer security)") of [clients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client_(computing) "Client (computing)"), poor quality [random number generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generator "Random number generator"), or [key escrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_escrow "Key escrow"). E2EE also does not address [traffic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_analysis "Traffic analysis"), which relates to things such as the identities of the end points and the times and quantities of messages that are sent.

</span>

Users and network administrators typically have different views of their networks. Users can share printers and some servers from a workgroup, which usually means they are in the same geographic location and are on the same LAN, whereas a Network Administrator is responsible to keep that network up and running. A [community of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community-of-interest_network "Community-of-interest network") has less of a connection of being in a local area, and should be thought of as a set of arbitrarily located users who share a set of servers, and possibly also communicate via [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer "Peer-to-peer") technologies.

Network administrators can see networks from both physical and logical perspectives. The physical perspective involves geographic locations, physical cabling, and the network elements (e.g., [routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing) "Router (computing)"), [bridges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_bridge "Network bridge") and [application layer gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-level_gateway "Application-level gateway")) that interconnect via the transmission media. Logical networks, called, in the TCP/IP architecture, [subnets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subnetwork "Subnetwork"), map onto one or more transmission media. For example, a common practice in a campus of buildings is to make a set of LAN cables in each building appear to be a common subnet, using [virtual LAN (VLAN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_LAN "Virtual LAN") technology.

Both users and administrators are aware, to varying extents, of the trust and scope characteristics of a network. Again using TCP/IP architectural terminology, an [intranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intranet "Intranet") is a community of interest under private administration usually by an enterprise, and is only accessible by authorized users (e.g. employees).

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-RFC2547-35">[35]</a>
</sup>

 Intranets do not have to be connected to the Internet, but generally have a limited connection. An [extranet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extranet "Extranet") is an extension of an intranet that allows secure communications to users outside of the intranet (e.g. business partners, customers).

<sup>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network#cite_note-RFC2547-35">[35]</a>
</sup>

Unofficially, the Internet is the set of users, enterprises, and content providers that are interconnected by [Internet Service Providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Service_Providers "Internet Service Providers") (ISP). From an engineering viewpoint, the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet "Internet") is the set of subnets, and aggregates of subnets, which share the registered [IP address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address "IP address") space and exchange information about the reachability of those IP addresses using the [Border Gateway Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Gateway_Protocol "Border Gateway Protocol"). Typically, the [human-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-readable "Human-readable") names of servers are translated to IP addresses, transparently to users, via the directory function of the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS).

Over the Internet, there can be [business-to-business (B2B)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business "Business-to-business"), [business-to-consumer (B2C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-consumer "Business-to-consumer") and [consumer-to-consumer (C2C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer-to-consumer_electronic_commerce "Consumer-to-consumer electronic commerce") communications. When money or sensitive information is exchanged, the communications are apt to be protected by some form of [communications security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_security "Communications security") mechanism. Intranets and extranets can be securely superimposed onto the Internet, without any access by general Internet users and administrators, using secure [Virtual Private Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Private_Network "Virtual Private Network") (VPN) technology.

Этот план Анатолий Иванович предложил сразу в высшую инстанцию, направив в январе 1959 года письмо генсеку КПСС Никите Хрущеву. Не получив ответа (хотя начинание на словах было поддержано в различных кругах), осенью того же года он заново направляет на самый верх письмо, приложив к нему 200-страничный детальный проект, получивший название ‘Красной книги’. [One can regard the magnum opus of Kitov’s career as his elaboration of the plan – unfortunately never brought into practical form – for the establishment of a computer network (the Unified State Network of Computer Centres – EGSVTs) for the control of the national economy and simultaneously for the resolution of military tasks. Anatolii Ivanovich presented this plan directly to the highest levels, sending a letter in January 1959 to the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Nikita Khrushchev. Not receiving a reply (although supported in various circles), in the autumn of the same year he again sent a letter to the very top, appending a 200-page detailed project plan, called the ‘Red Book’]”<span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fen.wikipedia.org%3AComputer+network&amp;rft.atitle=%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%D0%B8%D1%8F+%D0%BE+%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%BC%2C+%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BA+%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1+%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%B5%D1%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%B8+%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%81%D1%8F+%D0%BD%D0%B5+%D0%BD%D1%83%D0%B6%D0%B5%D0%BD+%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A1%D0%A0&amp;rft.date=2010-08-09&amp;rft.genre=unknown&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fria.ru%2Ftechnology%2F20100809%2F263341026.html&amp;rft.jtitle=ria.ru&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal">
