<div><div class="field-item even"><p>My car has been a real pain recently: it has a recurring error code that the garage can't seem to fix (apparently, it's a fault in the air conditioning, but the car <em>doesn't even have air con!</em>). Taking the car to the garage to get the code cleared means I lose the car for a day, which is getting annoying.</p>
<p>So, I decided to buy myself a USB connecter for the car's On Board Diagnostics (OBD) and see if I could get it working with Linux (specifically Kubuntu, but I doubt it matters). I was pleased to find that there was some decent Free Software available for Linux called <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/scantool/">Scantool</a> that enabled me to read and clear the codes on my car.</p>
<p>Here's how to install and use the software, and some screenshots...</p>
<h2>What is an OBD Connector and Where to get one</h2>
<p>Since 2004, the EU has required all cars to have a compatible connector for On Board Diagnostics. In 2007, the regulations were updated and now require all cars to have an OBD-II connector within 0.61m of the steering wheel, which makes it easily accessible. My boring old 2004 Ford Fiesta has one behind a little flap under the steering wheel.</p>

<p>OBD connectors come in USB and bluetooth variants, and you can pay through the nose for a fancy one or go with a cheap chinese knock-off. I opted for a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00IWLLX1Y?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00">generic &#xA3;6 USB model from Amazon</a>, which took ages to arrive but worked fine.</p>
<h2>Installing scantool</h2>
<p>Installation for this one is really simple: it's in the Ubuntu Universe section. Install with these commands:</p>
<pre>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install scantool</pre><p>
The software needs to access the OBD device, which is found at <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>. This is owned by root with the group <code>dialout</code>, so the proper way to run the scantool software is to add your user to the dialout group, e.g.:</p>
<pre>sudo usermod -a -G dialout sam</pre><p>
When researching before trying the software out, I noticed someone recommending you run scantool with root so that it can read the device. While running it with <code>sudo</code> would work, it violates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>: scantool doesn't need superuser privileges to run, it just needs to be able to read the OBD interface. Running it as root is lazy - <em>don't do it</em>!</p>
<h2>Usage / Screenshots</h2>
<p>To make the changes to your groups take effect, you need to either log out and back in, or you can use the <code>newgrp</code> command, which will let you use the new group straight away by changing your group ID to the one you specify, in this case dialout:</p>
<pre>newgrp dialout</pre><p>
Then check you are in the dialout group:</p>
<pre>groups</pre><p>
(You should see dialout as one of the groups in the list).</p>
<p>Now turn the ignition on, and then launch scantool:</p>
<pre>scantool</pre><p>
You should see the main menu:</p>

<p>If you select "read codes" now you will see the error codes along with explanations of what they mean (the codes are standard, but sometimes manufacturers have non-standard meanings, so you may get more than one explanation for each code):</p>

<p>If you know what the code means and you are sure you want to clear it, you can select <strong>clear</strong>. <em>Obligatory warning: I am not a mechanic. If you're not sure what the codes mean, ask a mechanic, and don't clear it unless you're sure it's OK.</em></p>

<p>Back to the main menu, and choose sensor data to see realtime readouts from the sensors on the car (the car needs to be running for this to work):</p>

<p>The <strong>tests</strong> option isn't implemented in this build, but the software still does more than enough to be useful!</p>
