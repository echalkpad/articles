 The best way to understand the value of an application
 monitoring system like Packetbeat is to try it on your
 own traffic. This quick tutorial will walk you through
 installing the essential components of the Packetbeat
 system:
 </p><ul>
 <li>The Packetbeat agents for collecting the traffic. You should install these on your servers so that they capture the network traffic.</li>
 <li>Elasticsearch for storage and search.</li>
 <li>Kibana for the UI.</li>
 </ul>

 </div>
 
 <p>
 For now, you can just install Elasticsearch and Kibana
 on a single VM or even on your laptop. The only
 condition is that this machine is accessible from the
 servers you want to monitor. As you add more agents and
 your traffic grows, you will want replace the single
 Elasticsearch instance with a cluster. You will
 probably also want to automate the installation
 process. But for now, let's just do the fun part.
 </p>

 <h2>Elasticsearch installation</h2>
 <p>
 <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/" target="_blank">Elasticsearch</a>
 is a distributed real-time storage, search and analytics
 engine. It can be used for many purposes, but one context where
 it excels is indexing streams of semi-structured data, like
 logs or decoded network packets.
 </p>
 <p>
 The binary packages of Elasticsearch have only one dependency:
 Java. Choose the tab that fits your system (deb for
 Debian/Ubuntu, rpm for Redhat/Centos/Fedora, binary for the
 others, including OS X):
 </p>

 

 <p>
 To test that the Elasticsearch daemon is up and
 running, try sending it an HTTP GET on port 9200:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 $ curl http://localhost:9200/
 {
 "status" : 200,
 "name" : "Jack Power",
 "version" : {
 "number" : "1.1.0",
 "build_hash" : "2181e113dea80b4a9e31e58e9686658a2d46e363",
 "build_timestamp" : "2014-03-25T15:59:51Z",
 "build_snapshot" : false,
 "lucene_version" : "4.7"
 },
 "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
 }
 </code>
 </pre>

 <h2>Kibana installation</h2>
 <p>
 <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/kibana/" target="_blank">Kibana</a>
 is a visualization application that gets its data
 from Elasticsearch. It provides a customizable and
 user-friendly UI in which you can combine various widget
 types to create your own dashboards. The dashboards can be
 easily saved, shared and linked.
 </p>

 <p>
 It is recommended to install Kibana on the same server as
 Elastic search, but not required.
 </p>

 <p>
 We have extended Kibana to support new panels specialized
 in visualizing network data. So it is best to download it
 from <a href="http://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat">Packetbeat GitHub account</a>:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 $ curl -L -O https://github.com/packetbeat/kibana/releases/download/v3.0.0-pb/kibana-3.0-packetbeat.tar.gz
 $ tar -xzvf kibana-3.0-packetbeat.tar.gz
 </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
 Kibana is a pure Javascript application running fully in
 the browser. It doesn't have or need a sever side part like
 most web applications do. Instead, you only needed a web
 server to serve the Javascript files and the static
 resources. For example, you can use python to create a
 simple web server:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 $ cd kibana-3.0-packetbeat
 $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
 Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 Now point your browser to port 8000 and you should see the
 Kibana web interface.
 </p>

 <h2>Packetbeat agent</h2>
 <p>
 Now that you have Elasticsearch and Kibana running, I'm
 sure you are eager to put some data in them. For this,
 install the Packetbeat agents on your application servers:
 </p>

 

 <div class="note">
 <h4>Note</h4>
 <p>
 Do you need 32 bits packages instead? Here are the <a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat/releases/download/v0.1.0/packetbeat_0.1.0-1_i386.deb">deb</a>, <a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat/releases/download/v0.1.0/packetbeat-0.1.0-1.el6.i686.rpm">rpm</a>
 and <a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat/releases/download/v0.1.0/packetbeat-0.1.0-i686.tar.gz">bin</a> files.
 </p>
 </div>

 <p>
 Before starting the agent, edit the configuration file:
 </p>
 <pre>
 <code>
 $ nano /etc/packetbeat/packetbeat.conf
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 First, set the IP address and port where the agent can
 find the Elasticsearch installation:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 [elasticsearch]
 # Set the host and port where to find Elasticsearch.
 host = "192.168.1.42"
 port = 9200
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 Select the network interface from which to capture
 the traffic. Packetbeat supports capturing all
 messages sent or received by the server on which
 it is installed. For this, use "any" as the device:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 [interfaces]
 # Select on which network interfaces to sniff. You can use the "any"
 # keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
 device = "any"
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 In the next section, you can configure the ports on
 which Packetbeat can find each protocol. If you use any
 non-standard ports, add them here. Otherwise, the
 default values should do just fine.
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 [protocols]
 # Configure which protocols to monitor and on which ports are they
 # running. You can disable a given protocol by commenting out its
 # configuration.
 [protocols.http]
 ports = [80, 8080, 8081, 5000, 8002]

 [protocols.mysql]
 ports = [3306]

 [protocols.redis]
 ports = [6379]
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 Finally, you can configure which are the processes that
 exchange the messages. This part is optional, but configuring
 the processes enables Packetbeat to not only show you between which
 servers the traffic is flowing, but also between which processes.
 It can even show you traffic from between two processes running on
 the same host.
 </p>
 <pre>
 <code>
 [procs]
 # Uncomment the following line to disable the process monitoring.
 # dont_read_from_proc = true

 # Which processes to monitor and how to find them. The processes can
 # be found by searching their command line by a given string.
 [procs.monitored.mysqld]
 cmdline_grep = "mysqld"

 [procs.monitored.nginx]
 cmdline_grep = "nginx"

 [procs.monitored.app]
 cmdline_grep = "gunicorn"
 </code>
 </pre>

 <div class="note">
 <h4>
 Process monitoring:
 </h4>

 <p>
 When it starts, and then periodically, the agent scans
 the process table for processes matching the
 configuration file. For each of these processes, it
 monitors which file descriptors it has opened. When a
 new packet is captured, it reads the list of active TCP
 connections and matches the corresponding one with the
 list of file descriptors.
 </p>

 <p>
 On a Linux system, all this information is available
 via the /proc filesystem, so the Packetbeat agent
 doesn't need a kernel module.
 </p>
 </div>

 <p>
 With this, you are ready to start the agent:
 </p>

 

 <h2>Kibana dashboards</h2>

 <p>
 Kibana has about dozen widget types that you can combine
 into pages to create dashboards that are best for you.
 We have created three sample dashboards to give you a
 good start and to demonstrate what is possible.
 </p>

 <p>
 To load our sample pages, follow these steps:
 </p>

 <pre>
 <code>
 $ curl -L -O https://github.com/packetbeat/dashboards/archive/v0.1.0.tar.gz
 $ tar xzvf v0.1.0.tar.gz
 $ cd dashboards-0.1.0/
 $ ./load.sh
 </code>
 </pre>

 <p>
 You should now have the following pages loaded in
 Kibana. You can switch between them by using the
 <i>Load</i> menu.
 </p>

 <ul>
 <li>
 Packetbeat Statistics: Contains high-level views
 like the network topology, the application layer
 protocols repartition, the response times
 repartition, and others.
 </li>
 <li>
 Packetbeat Search: This page enables you to do full
 text searches over the indexed network messages.
 </li>
 <li>
 Packetbeat Query Analysis: This page demonstrates more
 advanced statistics like the top N slow SQL
 queries, the database throughput or the most common
 MySQL errors.
 </li>
 </ul>

 <p>
 Congratulations! You just built yourself a great application
 monitoring and application performance management system.
