<div><div class="book-col book-span9"><p class="Long-Bodytext-20 book-indent">I sign a form and confirm that I don't have a history of seizures. Nord takes down my hair and puts a headband on my head. She positions two sponges dipped in saline solution on the front of my skull where the frontal cortex sits under my cranium. A towel around my neck mops up the water dripping down. This is definitely not a high-fashion look; I feel like Frankenstein's monster.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">She presses the button. "I don&#x2019;t feel anything." Zap. "Should I feel something now?" Zap. She explains that there might be some tingling of the skin and continues to administer the current to my cranium. Zap, zap, zap. I feel tingling but it could just be the cold water on my scalp.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">Then I'm given a brain-training n-back test on a PC in the corner. It's quite hard and the room is hot. I'm not very good at it and feel flustered. I expected heightened senses or a sharpening of my brain but I almost take a massive slug of the saline solution by accident. This isn't going as I'd hoped. Aren't I supposed to feel smarter?</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">"Saying tDCS makes you smarter is an unhelpful myth; but that doesn't mean that tiny specific tDCS might not make you better at tiny specific things," Nord explains. "Nor do smart drugs. They might make you better at concentrating, they don't make you smarter." </p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">We talk about recent studies that have cast doubt on the efficacy of tDCS but Nord is optimistic that neuroscience can help people with depression and other psychiatric conditions. She is worried about people using the kits at home, however. "tDCS should be more readily available if that means people can buy safe machines. Because of the publicity about tDCS you get people fabricating their own machines at home with seriously unusual side effects."</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">I leave feeling relaxed and a bit spaced out, but that might be tiredness from a few hours spent talking about complex science. I only had the electrical current for about five minutes. Perhaps when I try tDCS with the DIY community in east London they might be a little more cavalier with their dosages and times, although now I'm feeling a little more cautious after Nord's warnings; I don&#x2019;t really want skull burn.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">The next morning I talk on Skype to Xavier, a French national, who took part in Camilla's trial. Last summer, while working in the City as a banker, he began feeling depressed. He went to a GP who prescribed him pills. They didn't work. The doctor offered CBT but there was a six-month wait. Desperate, he took up the offer to be part of the UCL experiment that offered CBT alongside tDCS.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">"My friends thought it sounded a bit crazy but I thought, 'I need to find a solution'," he says.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">Although he doesn't actually know whether the tDCS he received was real, Xavier believes it was because he felt burning on his scalp. He's much better now and looks happy and healthy. I ask if he'd use electricity again. "In a controlled environment," he says. "The brain is the greatest asset we all have so you have to be careful."</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">It is people like Xavier that Marom Bikson, professor of biomedical engineering at the City College of New York, hopes will benefit from tDCS as it becomes mainstream.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">Bikson is a leading voice in the field of tDCS. He says: "I think, I hope, that tDCS has a huge potential to remove human suffering and that's why I'm very anxious for it to be made available."</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">As well as depression, he mentions fibromyalgia, neural pain and status epilepticus as serious health problems that might be treated with electricity. Depression is where he's seen the most encouraging results.</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">"That's why I'm not comfortable waiting 15 years for us to work out all the scientific questions. There are people suffering today who could benefit from this technology. Their lives are shattered by their diseases and it's so unfortunate that something that might &#x2013; big might &#x2013; be able to help them, and is considered so safe that they'll use it on college students, is not available."</p><p class="Long-Bodytext-20">But he's confident this is going to change very soon. "What is needed is clinical-grade tDCS which should be made available for people to use at home. That path needs to open up and I think it will later this year."</p></div></div>
