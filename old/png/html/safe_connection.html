	<p class=" text-LEFT">This article presents advanced Secure Shell (SSH) functionality and SSH-based tools for use on Windows. It does not question the fact that both Linux (<i>vsftpd</i>
, <i>proftpd</i>
) and Windows (IIS) let you operate a secure FTP server with standard tools and that there are countless secure and powerful FTP clients. The charm of SSH consists above all in being able to use remote logins, file transfers, port forwarding, VPN, and other functions ad hoc without extensive preparatory measures. For SSH, you only need to run the SSH daemon, <i>sshd</i>
, on the (Linux) server.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH offers maximum security thanks to these three properties:</p>
<ul>

<li>Encryption of transferred data, including login information.</li>

<li>Protection against manipulation of the transferred data (data integrity).</li>

<li>Authentication of the communication partner.</li>

</ul>
<p class=" text-LEFT">SSH always uses transmission encryption; it can use the default host key to ensure the integrity of the connection or the hosts, and it supports peer authentication. Although SSH &#x201C;only&#x201D; works by default with usernames and passwords, it also optionally supports asymmetric DSA and RSA key pairs.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>SSH Basics</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">The free Linux SSH Version, OpenSSH, is a spin-off of the classic SSH from 1999. The popular Windows SSH client PuTTY, developed by Simon Tatham, is also a free SSH implementation. It is subject to the MIT license and is currently at version 0.62 from 2011. All versions of SSH are largely compatible.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">The term Secure Shell is the umbrella for a bunch of remote access tools. The entire SSH suite contains the following tools:</p>
<ul>

<li><i>ssh</i>
 &#x2013; Replaces <i>rsh</i>
, <i>rlogin</i>
, and <i>telnet</i>
.</li>

<li><i>scp</i>
 &#x2013; Replaces <i>rcp</i>
.</li>

<li><i>sftp</i>
 &#x2013; Replaces <i>ftp</i>
.</li>

<li><i>sshd</i>
 &#x2013; The SSH server daemon.</li>

<li><i>ssh-keygen</i>
 &#x2013; Generates asymmetric public keys for authentication or manages or converts keys.</li>

<li><i>ssh keyscan</i>
 &#x2013; Searches for existing SSH public keys.</li>

<li><i>ssh-agent</i>
 &#x2013; Keeps the private key in memory until the user logs out.</li>

<li><i>ssh-add</i>
 &#x2013; Loads a private key into <i>ssh-agent</i>
.</li>

</ul>
<p class=" text-LEFT">The <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html" target="_blank">PuTTY</a> Suite offers the same variety of tools. To begin, admins must download the complete zip archive with all the PuTTY SSH tools and not just run the <i>.exe</i>
 installer, which only downloads and installs the PuTTY SSH client. However, the respective tools have slightly different names in PuTTY, such as <i>puttygen</i>
 or <i>psftp</i>
. In addition to the popular PuTTY, Windows admins have options for using SSH on Windows, such as the Cygwin Windows X server-based <a href="http://www.admin-magazine.com/Articles/MobaXterm-Unix-for-Windows" target="_blank">MobaXterm</a> or direct use of the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank">Cygwin</a> API compatibility layer.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Enabling SSH</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">Setting up the SSH server on the Linux side &#x2013; the SSH client generally is installed by default &#x2013; is not the subject of this article, but you can do this by installing the <i>openssh-server</i>
 (RHEL, Fedora) or <i>openssh</i>
 packages (the SUSE package contains the server and client) with the preferred package management tool.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">To enable the service, you need to start the <i>sshd</i>
 daemon and possibly add it permanently to the system boot configuration. You can do this, depending on your choice of distribution, with <i>/etc/init.d/sshd start</i>
 (SysV), <i>service sshd start</i>
 (Upstart), or <i>systemctl start sshd.service</i>
.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Additionally, the service &#x2013; if so desired &#x2013; must be permanently added to the system boot configuration. For this step, you could use systemd (openSUSE, Fedora) by typing <i>systemctl enable sshd.service</i>
 or <i>chkconfig sshd on</i>
 (RHEL/SysVinit). On Fedora and Red Hat, you need to stop the firewall, which runs by default, by typing <i>systemctl stop iptables.service</i>
, or create a rule for port 22 (SSH).</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Administrators typically do not need to make any adjustments to the main configuration file &#x2013; usually <i>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</i>
 &#x2013; with one exception. The exception is that many OpenSSH implementations prevent root access by default; uncommenting the following line:</p><pre>PermitRootLogin yes</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">lets you enable it.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Dealing with Host Keys</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">For Linux admins, dealing with the SSH host key is part of everyday life. Because a successful SSH connection requires a user account on the remote host, all SSH tools perform an authentication process. On Linux, typing</p><pre>ssh -l &lt;username&gt; &lt;remote IP address&gt;</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">is sufficient to open a connection to the remote server, which then asks for the password to match the specified username and transfers the usernames and passwords in encrypted format. The process is the same for PuTTY, but you might not immediately notice, because the login takes place behind the graphical interface (Figure 1).</p>

Figure 1: The login process with PuTTY.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">For PuTTY, you only need to enter the desired target host in the <i>Host Name</i>
 field of the default <i>Session</i>
 tab.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Host Keys</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH works with host keys by default to ensure integrity. For this reason, any SSH client will show its automatically transferred host key the first time it opens a connection (or the fingerprint belonging to the key); it then uses <i>permanently add 'IP address' (RSA) to the list of known hosts</i>
 to indicate that it did not know this key, and thus wants to add the key to its local <i>$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts</i>
 file. You must then decide whether to trust this server, that is, determine whether it is the server it claims to be. After all, an attacker could theoretically have hijacked an Internet connection.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Integrity could be ensured, for example, by retrieving the fingerprint of the remote server, which you could then compare with the key sent to you. The process is no different when using PuTTY as the SSH client, but PuTTY shows the dialog with the RSA fingerprint graphically (Figure 2) and offers to save the host key in the Windows registry format. At the same time PuTTY, keeps the host key in its cache until the next connection with the same server is opened.</p>

Figure 2: Like any SSH client, PuTTY shows the RSA host key of the remote host.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">The PuTTY developers provide a script (<i>kh2reg</i>
) on the project site with which the admin can convert existing host keys from the classical (Linux) known hosts format to a Windows <i>*.reg</i>
 file, if required. On the server side, the host key is stored in the <i>/etc/ssh</i>
 directory and is named <i>ssh_host_dsa_key</i>
 by default. Once connected, PuTTY also shows a classic login window for the server, and the admin can log in with a username and password. The server host key&#x2019;s fingerprint can be found by entering</p><pre>ssh-keygen -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub -l</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">in the SSH remote shell.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Key Issues</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">Windows admins and users can use secure public key authentication with PuTTY. The password prompt, which is enabled by default for SSH, is just one of the ways you can handle authentication with SSH. The function is no different from that on Linux, but PuTTY uses different tools and configuration files. Just to remind you: On Linux, the admin uses <i>ssh-keygen -t rsa</i>
 (optionally, <i>ssh-keygen -t dsa</i>
) to generate a new RSA or DSA key pair of public and private keys (Figure 3).</p>

Figure 3: Generating a RSA key pair on Linux.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH saves the key files under the name <i>id_rsa/id_dsa</i>
 and <i>id_rsa.pub</i>
 in the <i>.ssh</i>
 subdirectory in the user&#x2019;s home directory. In contrast, the public key is appended to the user&#x2019;s <i>$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>
 file. In the opposite direction, you need to copy your own public key to the appropriate user directory on the server, as follows:</p><pre>ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &lt;remote username&gt; @ &lt;Remote IP Address&gt;</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">PuTTY uses the <i>puttygen.exe</i>
 (PuTTY Key Generator) tool (instead of <i>ssh-keygen</i>
) to generate RSA (default) or DSA key pairs (Figure 4).</p>

Figure 4: An RSA key pair in PuTTY.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">Although you will find this tool on the PuTTY download page, make sure you have previously downloaded the full install zip file; <i>puttygen</i>
 should also be available below <i>Putty</i>
 in the Windows Start menu.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">To generate an RSA key pair, press the <i>Generate</i>
 button. Admins who need SSH1 RSA or DSA keys can select the appropriate type directly below the dialog. You can ensure the necessary randomness yourself here, by moving the mouse back and forth in the free area of the dialog box while generating the key. Then, you enter the desired key passphrase for <i>Key passphrase</i>
, as with <i>ssh-keygen</i>
 in Linux.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">You can use the appropriate buttons for saving the public and private keys on the client, and you can freely choose the name and path in the file browser. The typical PuTTY key extension is <i>*.ppk</i>
, which indicates the deviation from the standard Linux format. PuTTY RSA keys are therefore not compatible with OpenSSH keys. However, you can use Conversions on the menubar to import existing OpenSSH keys or export PuTTY keys.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">To transfer your own public key to the server, you can theoretically use WinSCP or <i>psftp</i>
 (PuTTY SFTP), but it is easier and faster to select the entire key shown in the key field and press Ctrl+C to copy it to the clipboard. Then, you can log in again normally on the remote server using PuTTY, launch any Linux editor (e.g., nano) against the <i>/$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys</i>
 file, and paste your key from the clipboard.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Public Key Authentication with PuTTY</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">If you want to change to public key authentication the next time you log in, enter the address of the desired host on the client-side PuTTY <i>Session</i>
 page, then &#x2013; under the Category menu &#x2013; click on <i>SSH/Auth</i>
 and enter the file name of your authentication key below <i>Private key file for authentication</i>
. You can press <i>Browse</i>
 to select the file in the file browser (Figure 5).</p>

Figure 5: PuTTY keys have slightly different names.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">Optionally, you can store the credentials for each session in a profile. The authentication sequence is identical on Linux and Unix. When you connect to the remote server, it asks for proof that the user has one of the public keys stored in the <i>authorized_keys</i>
 file for this user on the server. SSH thus prompts you for the passphrase for enabling the private key stored in the local <i>id_rsa.ppk</i>
 file. The connection will work only if the two keys match.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>SSH Agent</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">The public-key authentication shown here may be more secure, but admins have not gained much if they need to enter a passphrase now, instead of the original password. To automate this process, Linux comes with the <i>ssh-agent</i>
 tool, in which you can store your private key. The SSH agent autonomously takes care of the authentication process, with the advantage that you only need to enter your passphrase once. The agent retains the key in memory until the user logs out. SSH-Agent is automatically started in the background on most Linux distributions.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Linux has the <i>ssh-add</i>
 command for interacting with <i>ssh-agent</i>
; the <i>-l</i>
 option lists the currently stored keys. With the <a href="http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/" target="_blank">Windows MobaXterm SSH client</a>, you can easily enable the SSH agent, for example, in the program settings (Figure 6). The PuTTY Suite has the <i>pagent</i>
 (putty agent) tool for this.</p>

Figure 6: The SSH agent makes life easier.
</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">The MobaXterm SSH client is an interesting alternative to the popular PuTTY. Because MobaXterm is based on the Cygwin compatibility layer, the tool thinks it is running in a real Linux environment on the client side. This approach means that use of the Linux tools <i>ssh-keygen</i>
 and <i>ssh-copy-id</i>
 is possible, including the typical Linux configuration files in the <i>.ssh</i>
 subdirectory.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">A pleasant side effect is that the key files are compatible with standard OpenSSH. You only have to know that the relative home directory of the Linux environment corresponds to <i>C:\Users\User\Documents\MobaXterm</i>
<i>\home</i>
. Windows physical drives can be found below <i>/drives</i>
 in the MobaXterm environment.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>WinSCP</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH is useful not only for secure remote logins but also for secure file transfers. This task will also be the most common use for an SSH client for Windows. Although PuTTY is the most popular Windows SSH client, it is not very convenient in terms of file transfer. For example, PuTTY&#x2019;s Secure FTP client <i>psftp</i>
 is a classic CLI client; in principle, it behaves no differently from a Linux CLI client. In MobaXterm, however, you can enable a graphical SFTP browser in the settings, and it automatically pops up in the sidebar when a SSH connection is established (Figure 7).</p>

</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">Appropriate Windows alternatives such as <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php" target="_blank">WinSCP</a> also are available for the classic SSH tools <i>sftp</i>
 and <i>scp</i>
, as cryptographically secure alternatives to <i>ftp</i>
 and <i>rcp</i>
. The current version 5.1.5 of the GPL tool has just been released, and it is available on the <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/download.php" target="_blank">project website</a>. Installing the executable file is trivial. However, administrators should choose the custom installation, because then the <i>pagent</i>
 and <i>puttygen</i>
 tools and the new drag-and-drop shell extension are also conveniently installed.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">WinSCP also offers direct downloads via drag and drop and supports the standard SSH protocols <i>sftp</i>
 and <i>scp</i>
 via SSH1 and SSH2. Additionally, it has a GUI interface as well as a command-line interface and can process <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/docs/scripting" target="_blank">batch scripts</a>. WinSCP can also optionally handle authentication via the SSH password or public key method, and it supports <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/docs/ui_login_authentication" target="_blank">Kerberos (GSS)</a> identification.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">To open the connection, enter the desired host in the <i>Session</i>
 section of the <i>Host name</i>
 field, select the desired <i>Protocol</i>
, and enter the user credentials and password. Assuming that you ran <i>puttygen</i>
 previously to create a public/private key pair and copied the public key to the server, you can optionally specify a password instead of the file containing the private RSA key.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Trust Me</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">Because <i>scp</i>
 and <i>sftp</i>
 are based on SSH, WinSCP, like PuTTY, points out the unknown host key the first time you connect to a new server. If you trust the target host, you are taken to a Windows Explorer-like interface; its use is self-explanatory.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Copying files to the destination host, or in the opposite direction, is an easy process using either by drag and drop, function keys, or Norton Commander-like menus (Figure 8).</p>

. Sshfs is a <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace)</a> module that lets admins bind remote Linux machines to the local filesystem of the Linux client via SSH. The use of <i>sshfs</i>
 does not question the usefulness and functionality of Samba, but using Samba involves some installation and configuration overhead on the server and the client, whereas <i>sshfs</i>
 can be leveraged with little effort.</p>

This open source tool is available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/swish/files/swish/swish-0.7.3/swish-0.7.3.exe/download" target="_blank">SourceForge</a>, and the current version is 0.74 (see also the &#x201C;WinSSH&#x201D; box).

Also, the connection still needs a name under which to <i>Create</i>

</span> </div><p class=" text-LEFT">Key management is the front end for pagent; it displays the cached key or helps admins add new keys.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Port Forwarding</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH can also secure any other protocol, such as FTP, with its port forwarding function. SSH port forwarding redirects the specified ports via a secure SSH connection, and SSH itself takes the role of a proxy. It accepts connections on one side of the tunnel and connects them at the other end with the specified server as the connection endpoint.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">SSH tunnel has two operating modes: Local port forwarding and remote port forwarding (outbound/inbound tunnel), where typically local port forwarding is used. The parameters <i>-L</i>
 or <i>-R</i>
 indicate the direction. In local port forwarding, SSH routes an inbound port on a local client through a secure SSH channel to a port on the remote SSH server. The SSH syntax looks like this on a Linux client, for example:</p><pre>ssh root@www.thomas-drilling.de -L 555:www.thomas-drilling.de:21</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">The command redirects the insecure FTP connection via a secure SSH connection to the server <i>www.thomas-drilling.de</i>
 with a default port of 21. If an SSH server is running on the server and the client, the <i>ws1-fed</i>
 client opens a secure SSH connection. The local SSH server then listens to all requests received on the local port 555 of <i>ws1-fed</i>
, and forwards them to port 21 on the remote host, <i>www.thomas-drilling.de</i>
.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Any further communication then takes place exclusively via the previously established SSH connection. The admin can now enter</p><pre>ftp localhost 555</pre><p class=" text-LEFT">on the local host <i>ws1-fed</i>
 to start the FTP client in a second terminal session (basically opening a session to itself) to access the FTP server automatically at the other end. The difference now is that the channel is secure. The best thing about using the Cygwin-based tool, MobaXterm, is that you can point and click in the <i>Tools | MobaSSHTunnel</i>
 menu to put together the whole port forwarding configuration graphically.</p><p class=" text-LEFT">Although FTP is not the best example, given the SFTP alternatives shown, this approach works with any other port or service as well. Regardless of whether the particular service is regarded to be inherently secure or insecure, admins will always benefit from the encrypted connection in SSH port forwarding.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Conclusions</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">In 14 years of its existence, SSH has not lost any of its usefulness, particularly for managing hosts or user interfaces. The word has spread, and Windows administrators can now turn to many graphical tools, such as PuTTY and MobaXterm, as clients.</p><p class=" text-LEFT"><b>Info</b></p><p class=" text-LEFT">
