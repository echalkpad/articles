<p>I&#x2019;ve been using tmux for about six months now and it has become just as
essential to my workflow as vim. Pane and window management, copy-mode for
navigating output, and session management make it a no-brainer for those who
live in the terminal (and especially vim). I&#x2019;ve compiled a list of tmux
commands I use daily to help me work more efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>

<p>If a tmux command I mention is bound to a keyboard shortcut by default,
I&#x2019;ll note that in parenthesis.</p>

<p>They&#x2019;re accessed by entering a key combination called the prefix
and then typing a letter.</p>

<p>For example, if you see <code>prefix + d</code> below,
that means you would first hit (and release) <code>Control + b</code>
and then type <code>d</code>.</p>

<p>The prefix can also be changed,
which I&#x2019;ll show you how to do <a href="https://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course#must-haves">later</a>.</p>

<h2 id="session-management">Session Management</h2>

<p>Sessions are useful for completely separating work environments. I have a
&#x2018;Work&#x2019; session and a 'Play&#x2019; session; in 'Work&#x2019;, I keep everything open that I
need during my day-to-day development, while in 'Play&#x2019;, I keep open current
open-source gems or other work I hack on at home.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>tmux new -s session_name</code></dt>
 <dd>creates a new tmux session named session_name</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux attach -t session_name</code></dt>
 <dd>attaches to an existing tmux session named session_name</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux switch -t session_name</code></dt>
 <dd>switches to an existing session named session_name</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux list-sessions</code></dt>
 <dd>lists existing tmux sessions</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux detach (prefix + d)</code></dt>
 <dd>detach the currently attached session</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>

<p>tmux has a tabbed interface, but it calls its tabs &#x201C;Windows&#x201D;. To stay
organized, I rename all the windows I use; if I&#x2019;m hacking on a gem, I&#x2019;ll name
the window that gem&#x2019;s name. The same thing goes for client applications. That
way, I can recognize windows by context and not what application it&#x2019;s running.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>tmux new-window (prefix + c)</code></dt>
 <dd>create a new window</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux select-window -t :0-9 (prefix + 0-9)</code></dt>
 <dd>move to the window based on index</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux rename-window (prefix + ,)</code></dt>
 <dd>rename the current window</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="panes">Panes</h2>

<p>Panes take my development time from bland to awesome. They&#x2019;re the reason I was
able to uninstall MacVim and develop solely in iTerm2. I don&#x2019;t have to switch
applications to switch contexts (editing, reading logs, IRB, etc.) - everything
I do, I do in a terminal now. People argue that OS X&#x2019;s Cmd+Tab is just as
fast, but I don&#x2019;t think so.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>tmux split-window (prefix + ")</code></dt>
 <dd>splits the window into two vertical panes</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux split-window -h (prefix + %)</code></dt>
 <dd>splits the window into two horizontal panes</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux swap-pane -[UDLR] (prefix + { or })</code></dt>
 <dd>swaps pane with another in the specified direction</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux select-pane -[UDLR]</code></dt>
 <dd>selects the next pane in the specified direction</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux select-pane -t :.+</code></dt>
 <dd>selects the next pane in numerical order</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="helpful-tmux-commands">Helpful tmux commands</h2>

<dl>
 <dt><code>tmux list-keys</code></dt>
 <dd>lists out every bound key and the tmux command it runs</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux list-commands</code></dt>
 <dd>lists out every tmux command and its arguments</dd>
 <dt><code>tmux info</code></dt>
 <dd>lists out every session, window, pane, its pid, etc. </dd>
 <dt><code>tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf</code></dt>
 <dd>reloads the current tmux configuration (based on a default tmux config)</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="must-haves">Must-haves</h2>

<p>These are some of my must-haves in my tmux config:</p>

<pre><code># remap prefix to Control + a
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# force a reload of the config file
unbind r
bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf

# quick pane cycling
unbind ^A
bind ^A select-pane -t :.+
</code></pre>

<h2 id="workflow">Workflow</h2>

<p>During the day, I&#x2019;ll work on one or two Rails apps, work on my dotfiles, run
irssi, and maybe run vim in another window to take notes for myself. As I
mentioned, I run all of this inside one tmux session (named work) and switch
between the different windows throughout the day.</p>

<p>When I&#x2019;m working on any Ruby work specifically, I&#x2019;ll have a 75%/25% vertical
split for vim and a terminal so I can run tests, interact with git, and code.
If I run tests or <code>git diff</code> and want to see more output than the 25% allots
me, I&#x2019;ll use tmux to swap the panes and then move into copy mode to see
whatever I need to see.</p>

<p>Finally, I run <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/iterm2home/">iTerm2</a> in
full-screen mode. Switching between OS X apps for an editor and a terminal is
for chumps!</p>
