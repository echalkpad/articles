<p>Sometimes it can seem as though the more we think we know a historical figure, the less we actually do. Helen Keller? We&#x2019;ve all seen (or think we&#x2019;ve seen) some version of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miracle_Worker">The Miracle Worker</a></em>, right?&#x2014;even if we haven&#x2019;t actually read <a href="http://amzn.to/1cvxP6o">Keller&#x2019;s autobiography</a>. And Mark Twain? He can seem like an old family friend. But I find people are often surprised to learn that Keller was a radical socialist firebrand, in sympathy with workers&#x2019; movements worldwide. In <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/keller-helen/works/1920s/29_x01.htm">a short article in praise of Lenin</a>, for example, Keller once wrote, &#x201C;I cry out against people who uphold the empire of gold&#x2026;. I am perfectly sure that love will bring everything right in the end, but I cannot help sympathizing with the oppressed who feel driven to use force to gain the rights that belong to them.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Twain took a more pessimistic, ironic approach, yet he thoroughly opposed religious dogma, slavery, and imperialism. &#x201C;I am always on the side of the revolutionists,&#x201D; <a href="http://socialistworker.org/2010/04/21/the-twain-they-didnt-teach">he wrote</a>, &#x201C;because there never was a revolution unless there were some oppressive and intolerable conditions against which to revolute.&#x201D; While a great many people grow more conservative with age, Twain and Keller both grew more radical, which in part accounts for another little-known fact about these two nineteenth century American celebrities: they formed a very close and lasting friendship that, at least in Keller&#x2019;s case, may have been one of the most important relationships in either figure&#x2019;s life.</p>

<p>Twain&#x2019;s importance to Keller, and hers to him, begins in 1895, when the two met at a lunch held for Keller in New York. According to <a href="http://www.historyofredding.com/epl/twain-keller-exhibit1.htm">the Mark Twain Library&#x2019;s extensive documentary exhibit</a>, Keller &#x201C;seemed to feel more at ease with Twain than with any of the other guests.&#x201D; She would later write, &#x201C;He treated me not as a freak, but as a handicapped woman seeking a way to circumvent extraordinary difficulties.&#x201D;<i>&#xA0;</i>Twain was taken as well, surprised by &#x201C;her quickness and intelligence.&#x201D; After the meeting, he wrote to his benefactor Henry H. Rogers, asking Rogers to fund Keller&#x2019;s education. Rogers, the Mark Twain Library tells us, &#x201C;personally took charge of Helen Keller&#x2019;s fortunes, and out of his own means made it possible for her to continue her education and to achieve for herself the enduring fame which Mark Twain had foreseen.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://daily.jstor.org/historys-odd-couple-mark-twain-helen-keller/">Twain wrote to his wealthy friend</a>, &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t do for America to allow this marvelous child to retire from her studies because of poverty. If she can go on with them she will make a fame that will endure in history for centuries.&#x201D; Thereafter, the two would maintain a &#x201C;special friendship,&#x201D; sustained not only by their political sentiments, but also by a love of animals, travel, and <a href="http://www.historyofredding.com/epl/twain-keller-exhibit2.htm">other personal similarities</a>. Both writers came to live in <a href="http://www.historyofredding.com/epl/twain-keller-exhibit3.htm">Fairfield County, Connecticut at the end of their lives</a>, and she visited him at his Redding home, Stormfield, in 1909, the year before his death (see them there at the top of the post, and <a href="http://www.historyofredding.com/epl/twain-keller-exhibit4.htm">more photos here</a>). Twain was especially impressed by Keller&#x2019;s autobiography, <a href="http://braillebug.afb.org/hktwain.asp">writing to her</a>, &#x201C;I am charmed with your book&#x2014;enchanted.&#x201D; (See his endorsement in a 1903 advertisement, below.)</p>

<p>Twain also came to Keller&#x2019;s defense, ten years later, after reading in her book about a plagiarism scandal that occurred in 1892 when, at only twelve years old, she was accused of lifting her short story &#x201C;The Frost King&#x201D; from Margaret Canby&#x2019;s &#x201C;Frost Fairies.&#x201D; Though a tribunal acquitted Keller of the charges, the incident still piqued Twain, who called it &#x201C;unspeakably funny and owlishly idiotic and grotesque&#x201D; in a 1903 letter in which he also declared: &#x201C;The kernel, the soul&#x2014;let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of <em>all</em> human utterance&#x2014;is plagiarism.&#x201D; What differs from work to work, he contends is &#x201C;the <em>phrasing</em> of a story&#x201D;; Keller&#x2019;s accusers, he writes protectively, were &#x201C;solemn donkeys breaking a little child&#x2019;s heart.&#x201D; (The exquisitely-worded letter is well worth reading in full <a href="http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/05/bulk-of-all-human-utterances-is.html">at Letters of Note</a>).</p>

<p>We also have Twain&#x2014;not <a href="http://www.playbill.com/news/article/william-gibson-author-of-the-miracle-worker-and-two-for-the-seesaw-dies-at--155622">playwright William Gibson</a>&#x2014;to thank for the &#x201C;miracle worker&#x201D; title given to Keller&#x2019;s teacher, Anne Sullivan. (See Keller, Sullivan, Twain, and Sullivan&#x2019;s husband John Macy above at Twain&#x2019;s home). As a tribute to Sullivan for her tireless work with Keller, he presented her with a postcard that read, &#x201C;To Mrs. John Sullivan Macy with warm regard &amp; with limitless admiration of the wonders she has performed as a &#x2018;miracle-worker.&#x2019;&#x201D; In his 1903 letter to Keller, he called Sullivan &#x201C;your other half&#x2026; for it took the pair of you to make complete and perfect whole.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Twain praised Sullivan effusively for &#x201C;her brilliancy, penetration, originality, wisdom, character, and the fine literary competencies of her pen.&#x201D; But he reserved his highest praise for Keller herself. &#x201C;You are a wonderful creature,&#x201D; he wrote, &#x201C;The most wonderful in the world.&#x201D; Keller&#x2019;s praise of her friend Twain was no less lofty. &#x201C;I have been in Eden three days and I saw a King,&#x201D; she wrote in his guestbook during her visit to Stormfield, &#x201C;I knew he was a King the minute I touched him though I had never touched a King before.&#x201D; The <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/07/21/1225327/-Mark-Twain-s-Autobiography-Honors-Helen-Keller">last words in Twain&#x2019;s autobiography</a>, the first volume anyway&#x2014;which he only allowed to be published in 2010&#x2014;are Keller&#x2019;s; &#x201C;You once told me you were a pessimist, Mr. Clemons,&#x201D; he quotes her as saying, &#x201C;but great men are usually mistaken about themselves. You are an optimist.&#x201D;</p>
