<p>The following sections cover in detail the steps you need to take to build your
own application monitoring + log aggregation system. Don't let the amount of
text below discourage you, everything is quite simple and completing it
shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Decide on the architecture and get servers</h3>
<p>Packetbeat Deploy gives you flexibility in deployment, while also keeping
things simple at the beginning. In this tutorial, we'll give two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>an all-in-one installation, in which all components except the agents are
 running on a single server. This is useful for trying things and for
 applications without too much traffic. No redundancy is provided in
 this setup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an installation on 3 servers. All servers run an Elasticsearch node and one
 of them also has the <em>aggregator</em> role and serves the Kibana web interface.
 In this setup the data is duplicated to one replica, so loosing one of the
 severs doesn't mean data loss. If the <em>aggregator</em> node is lost, the system
 doesn't record data for the time the <em>aggregator</em> is down, but the data that
 was already indexed is not lost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the Deploy system itself is open-source, you can easily extend it later
to more elaborate designs, including removing the single point of failure.</p>
<p>The servers running the Aggregator node and the Elasticsearch nodes currently
need to be <em>Debian 7</em> or newer. Extending this to support more operating system
is easy, but for now we want to keep our testing efforts lower.</p>
<p>Most cloud providers offer Debian images. For example, on <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital
Ocean</a>, you can select the <code>Debian 7.0 x64</code> image:</p>
<p><img alt="Select image" src="http://packetbeat.com/static/img/digitalocean-debian.png"></p>
<p>If you want to run the Packetbeat system on one or more physical servers,
you need to install Debian 7 on all of them.</p>
<p>Note that the Debian 7 is a requirement only for the servers running the
Packetbeat Monitoring System itself. Your applications servers can run any
Debian based (e.g. Ubuntu) or RedHat based (e.g. CentOS, Oracle Linux)
distribution. Running the Packetbeat agents is also possible on Windows, but
Packetbeat Deploy currently doesn't support it.</p>
<p>We recommend using servers with at least 512 MB RAM each.</p>
<h3>Step 2: Clone the Packetbeat Deploy repository</h3>
<p>You should run this and the next steps on a computer that has SSH access to all
the servers, ideally using key based authentication.</p>
<p>If you have Git installed on your computer, simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="c1">//github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-deploy.git</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you plan to modify the deploy scripts or you are fine with storing the
configuration files on GitHub, it might be a good idea to first fork the
<a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-deploy">packetbeat-deploy</a> repository
and then clone your fork.</p>
<p>If you don't have Git installed or don't want to use it, you can also download
an archive from
<a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-deploy/archive/v0.3.1.zip">GitHub</a>.
Simply unzip it and continue to the next step.</p>
<h3>Step 3: Create the inventory file</h3>
<p>An Ansible <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/intro_inventory.html">inventory file</a> is a
simple configuration file defining your network. It typically groups hosts by
their intended role in your system.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating an inventory file named <code>hosts</code> in the
<code>packetbeat-deploy</code> folder.</p>
<p>For the <strong>all-in-one</strong> example, your inventory file should look something like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">servers</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">app1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In this example, the <code>aggregator.example.com</code> is the hostname of the system
running the monitoring system. The rest of the servers are your application
servers, on which Packetbeat Deploy will install the Packetbeat and Logstash
agents.</p>
<p><img alt="Packetbeat all-in-one" src="http://packetbeat.com/static/img/pb_system_allinone.png"></p>
<p>You can also use IP addresses instead of hostnames, something like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggrgator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="mf">10.50.10.15</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">servers</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="mf">10.50.50.1</span>
<span class="mf">10.50.50.2</span>
<span class="mf">10.50.50.2</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If you don't want to use Ansible for installing the Packetbeat and Logstash
agents (for example, if you already do that via Chef or Puppet), you can simply
remove the <code>[app-servers]</code> section from the inventory file, so you get
something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggrgator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="mf">10.50.10.15</span>
</pre></div>


<p>For the <strong>installation on 3 severs</strong>, your inventory file should look something
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">packetbeat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">esnodes</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">esnode1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">esnode2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">servers</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">app1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p><img alt="Packetbeat on 3 servers" src="http://packetbeat.com/static/img/pb_system_multiple.png"></p>
<p>The inventory file can also contain configuration options on a per host basis.
One usage for this is setting the interface on which the services bind to. The
default is <code>eth0</code>, but in some cases you might want to use a different
device. You can change the interface like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">packetbeat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">main_iface</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">eth1</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">esnodes</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">esnode1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">main_iface</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">eth1</span>
<span class="n">esnode2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">main_iface</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">eth1</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">app</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">servers</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">app1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app2</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
<span class="n">app3</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another parameter that you might need to adjust is the SSH user that should be
used by Ansible to connect to the servers. The parameter is named
<code>ansible_ssh_user</code> and you can set it like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># packetbeat-deploy/hosts</span>

<span class="p">[</span><span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">packetbeat</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">example</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="n">ansible_ssh_user</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">root</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Step 4: Adjust configuration files</h3>
<p>Packetbeat Deploy generally uses sane defaults and uses environmental
information to automatically set the right configuration paramters. For
example, it automatically configures Elasticsearch to use half of the available
memory on each node. So while you normally don't need to change any of the
default configuration variables, you can have a look over the following files
to see if you want anything different. Packetbeat Deploy keeps the options
organized per role, so you have too look into the <code>vars</code> folder of each role:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">roles</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">esnode</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
<span class="n">roles</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">aggregator</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
<span class="n">roles</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">kibana</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
<span class="n">roles</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">packetbeat</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
<span class="n">roles</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">logstash</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">vars</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">main</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In particular you might want to ship different log files from the logstash
configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># roles/logstash/vars/main.yml</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
 <span class="nl">file_inputs:</span>
 <span class="nl">syslog:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">path:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s">"/var/log/syslog"</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s">"/var/log/messages"</span>
 <span class="nl">nginx_access:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">path:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s">"/var/log/nginx/access.log"</span>
 <span class="nl">nginx_error:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">path:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s">"/var/log/nginx/error.log"</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You might also want to adjust the TCP ports that the Packetbeat agent sniffs
on:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># roles/packetbeat/vars/main.yml</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
 <span class="nl">protocols:</span>
 <span class="nl">http:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">ports:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">80</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">8080</span>
 <span class="nl">mysql:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">ports:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">3306</span>
 <span class="nl">pgsql:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">ports:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">5432</span>
 <span class="nl">redis:</span>
 <span class="nl">enabled:</span> <span class="nb">true</span>
 <span class="nl">ports:</span>
 <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">6379</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>If your application doesn't use some of the protocols above, simply set
<code>enabled</code> to false to disable them.</p>
<p>Another important setting is the amount of history the Packetbeat Monitoring
System stores. A nightly curator task will delete all indexes older than a
given amount of days. The default is 3 days, which we think is usually enough
for troubleshooting while keeping the disk requirements relatively low. You can
change it from the <em>Aggregator</em> <code>vars</code> file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="cp"># roles/aggregator/vars/main.yml</span>
<span class="nl">aggregator:</span>
 <span class="p">...</span>
 <span class="nl">config:</span>
 <span class="nl">days_of_history:</span> <span class="mi">3</span>
 <span class="p">...</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Step 5: Install Ansible and run the playbook</h3>
<p>There are <a href="http://docs.ansible.com/intro_installation.html">multiple ways</a> to
install Ansible, you should choose the one that makes the most sense on your
operating system. However, if you have python already installed, the following
steps should be enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">easy_install</span> <span class="n">pip</span>
 <span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">ansible</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Now it's time to get everything up by running the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">ansible</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">playbook</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">hosts</span> <span class="n">site</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Where <code>hosts</code> is the inventory file you created in Step 3.</p>
<p>If you get any errors running the above command, please open a <a href="https://github.com/packetbeat/packetbeat-deploy/issues">GitHub
issue</a> and include the
output you get. We'll help you figure out what the problem is and how to solve
it.</p>
<p>After the installation is finished, you can access the web interface by opening
the Aggregator's URL in the browser.</p>

<p><img alt="Packetbeat screenshot" width="800" src="http://packetbeat.com/static/img/kibana_screenshot.png"></p>

<h3>Upgrading</h3>
<p>You can keep you monitoring system up-to-date by simply updating the
<code>packetbeat-deploy</code> repository and running the deploy command again:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">pull</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">update</span>
 <span class="n">ansible</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">playbook</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">hosts</span> <span class="n">site</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
</pre></div>


<h3>Adding or removing servers</h3>
<p>If you want to add or remove servers to the Packetbeat Monitoring System,
including moving from an all-in-one setup to multiple servers, simply edit the
inventory file and run the same <code>ansible-playbook</code> command again.</p>
<p>Also if you upgrade the available RAM on the servers, run the playbook command
again to re-create the configuration files and restart the required services:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre> <span class="n">ansible</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">playbook</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">i</span> <span class="n">hosts</span> <span class="n">site</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">yml</span>
</pre></div>


<p>That's all, congratulations on your new application monitoring system!</p>
