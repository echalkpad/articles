<p>Nothing ever need be a mystery on Linux as it has a large number of excellent utilities for discovering hardware and monitoring hardware health. Here are a handful of good tools for spotting possible hard drive failure, displaying hardware information and monitoring temperatures, fans, voltages, email, music players and more.&#xA0;</p>

<h3>Hard Drive Health</h3>
<p>You're probably familiar with the excellent&#xA0;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki">smartmontools</a>&#xA0;for monitoring hard drive health, and getting early warning of possible drive failure. Smartmontools runs tests and reads data on drives that have the Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) system built into them. It's been around seemingly forever, but did you know there is a graphical interface for it?&#xA0;<a href="http://gsmartcontrol.berlios.de/home/index.php/en/Home">SmartControl</a>&#xA0;puts a nice interface on smartmontools and supports all of its functions.</p>
<p>You can run a short or long self-test with a button click, and GSmartControl is especially valuable for quickly and easily finding log files and reading SMART attributes data, reading test results, and seeing detailed data on your hard drives.</p>
<h3>Monitoring and Alerting</h3>
<p>It's not fun when your first warning of a failed CPU fan is a melted-down CPU.&#xA0;<a href="http://lm-sensors.org/">lm-sensors</a>&#xA0;is still my top choice for monitoring temperatures, fans, and voltages:</p>

<pre> $ sensors
atk0110-acpi-0
Adapter: ACPI interface
Vcore Voltage: +1.23 V (min = +0.85 V, max = +1.60 V)
 +3.3 Voltage: +3.31 V (min = +2.97 V, max = +3.63 V)
 +5 Voltage: +4.97 V (min = +4.50 V, max = +5.50 V)
 +12 Voltage: +12.15 V (min = +10.20 V, max = +13.80 V)

MB Temperature: +40.0&#xC2;&#xB0;C (high = +45.0&#xC2;&#xB0;C, crit = +75.0&#xC2;&#xB0;C)</pre>
<p>I wish for a nice graphical front-end and alerter to lm-sensors; GNOME and KDE release nice ones and then they disappear.&#xA0;<a href="http://freecode.com/projects/xsensors">Xsensors</a>&#xA0;is simple, the xfce4-sensors-plugin looks great in XFCE, and the KDE4 System Monitor widget is all right, but it's not very configurable and does no alerting.&#xA0;<a href="http://wpitchoune.net/blog/psensor/">psensor</a>&#xA0;is a rather nice, and it can run as a server for remote monitoring.&#xA0;<a href="http://freecode.com/projects/gkrellm">GKrellM</a>&#xA0;is an old favorite cram-full of features, alerting, and configurability.</p>
<p><a href="http://conky.sourceforge.net/">Conky</a>&#xA0;takes the prize for most objects supported. In addition to the usual system monitors it monitors email, music players, instant messaging, logfiles, weather forecast, and pretty much anything you want. If there isn't a plugin to do what you want you can write one.&#xA0;</p>
<h3>Probing Hardware</h3>
<p>It helps to know what is on your system, and you're probably familiar with the&#xA0;<code>lscpi</code>&#xA0;command for getting detailed information on everything connected to the PCI bus. Here are a few options you may not know about:</p>
<p><code>lspci</code>&#xA0;with no options shows a hardware list with vendor names, chipsets, and device types.</p>
<p><code>lspci -k</code>&#xA0;displays the kernel driver in use for each device, and available kernel modules, like this example for an Nvidia graphics card:</p>
<pre>01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation G98 [GeForce 8400 GS] (rev a1)
 Subsystem: Micro-Star International Co., Ltd. Device 1162
 Kernel driver in use: nvidia
 Kernel modules: nvidia_current, nouveau, nvidiafb</pre>
<p><code>lspci -t</code>&#xA0;displays a tree view that shows the relationships between your devices.</p>
<p>The vendor names, chipsets, subsystems, device classes-- all the information displayed by&#xA0;<code>lspci</code>&#xA0;comes from a giant database, the&#xA0;<a href="http://pciids.sourceforge.net/">PCI ID Repository</a>. You can update your local copy of this database,&#xA0;<code>/usr/share/misc/pci.ids</code>, by running the&#xA0;<code>update-pciids</code>&#xA0;command as root.</p>
<h3>Using dmidecode</h3>
<p><code>dmidecode</code>&#xA0;is a wonderful utility for getting information about everything on your motherboard without opening the case, or booting to the BIOS. If you run&#xA0;<code>dmidecode</code>&#xA0;with no options it spits out pages of data. You can select what you want to see by consulting the DMI types table in&#xA0;<code>man dmidecode</code>. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><em>How much RAM does your motherboard support?</em></p>
<pre>$ sudo dmidecode -t 16
# dmidecode 2.9
SMBIOS 2.5 present.
Handle 0x0033, DMI type 16, 15 bytes
Physical Memory Array

<p><em>How much RAM is installed, and in which slots? This example has most of the output snipped:</em></p>
<pre>$ sudo dmidecode -t 17
# dmidecode 2.9
SMBIOS 2.5 present.
Handle 0x0035, DMI type 17, 27 bytes
Memory Device

<p><em>What are the onboard devices, such as video, networking, sound?</em></p>
<pre>$ sudo dmidecode -t 10 
# dmidecode 2.9
SMBIOS 2.5 present.
Handle 0x002C, DMI type 10, 6 bytes

<p>And much, much more, which is all detailed in the man page.</p>
<h3>Using lshw</h3>
<p>The&#xA0;<code>lshw</code>&#xA0;command also gives a detailed peek inside your PC, and you can invoke its graphical view with&#xA0;<code>lshw -X</code>&#xA0;(left). It's a little weird to navigate, but everything is there.</p>
<p>I like the way&#xA0;<code>lshw</code>&#xA0;presents information. It includes details like filesystem types and sizes, bus information, and capabilities. It has a couple of nice extras: the&#xA0;<code>-sanitize</code>&#xA0;option scrubs IP addresses, serial numbers, and other identifiers, and the&#xA0;<code>-class</code>&#xA0;option lets you choose categories such as volume and disk for block devices, memory, and display. Run&#xA0;<code>lshw -short</code>&#xA0;to see what the categories are. Here is an abbreviated example:</p>


<pre>$ sudo lshw -short
