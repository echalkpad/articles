## The Haxe Toolkit

The **Haxe** cross-platform toolkit consists in the following components :

The Haxe Programming Language

The Haxe programming language is a high level strictly typed programming language which is used by the Haxe compiler to produce cross-platform native code. The Haxe programming language is easy to learn if you are familiar already with either Java,C++,PHP,AS3 or similar object oriented languages. The Haxe programming language has been especially designed in order to adapt the various platforms native behaviors and allow efficient cross-platform development.

The Haxe Cross-Compiler

The Haxe Compiler is responsible for translating the Haxe programming language to the target platform native source code or binary. Each platform is natively supported, without any overhead coming from running inside a virtual machine. The Haxe Compiler is very efficient and can compile thousands of classes in seconds.
