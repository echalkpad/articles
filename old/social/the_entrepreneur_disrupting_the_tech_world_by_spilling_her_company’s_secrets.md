At the age of 25, Limor Fried founded Adafuit, ten years ago, with the goal of creating the go-to online hub for learning electronics and creating the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill levels. Located in New York City, Adafruit has grown to over 50 employees, with a 15,000 square-foot factory, and it is a force to be reckoned with in maker culture, thanks to its DIY open-source electronic hardware kits and variety of other ways it props up creativity and tech explorations. Adafruit now offers tools, equipment and electronics that Fried personally selects, tests and approves before going into the Adafruit store. As well, she does two weekly [video shows](http://www.adafruit.com/shows) about electronics, and the Adafruit site offers over [700 tutorials](http://learn.adafruit.com/).

The company's innovative approach and contributions to maker culture have earned Fried various accolades: she was named _Entrepreneur_ magazine's Entrepreneur of the Year in 2012, and was also the first female engineer on the cover of _WIRED_ magazine.

Collectively spoke with Fried, who is speaking this week at the [Disrupt NY tech conference](http://techcrunch.com/events/disrupt-ny-2015/speakers/#.9ri6ol:w4ND), to get some insight into what it's like to be a bad-ass, young, female tech engineer and entrepreneur, and also what she attributes to Adafruit's successful disruption of the tech industry.

**Collectively: What made you want to become an engineer?**

<span><strong>Fried: </strong>When I was about 7 or 8 I saw a bunch of balloons stuck to the ceiling at a local mall, no one could reach them so I went home and constructed a mechanical arm. After going back and retrieving all the balloons it was then I realized engineering was for me.</span>

**Where did you get the idea for Adafruit?**

My goal was to create the best place online for learning electronics and making the best designed products for makers of all ages and skill levels. Since then, Adafruit has expanded offerings to include tools, equipment and electronics that I personally select, test and approve before going in to the Adafruit store.

**How is Adafruit "disrupting" the tech world -- explain this as if you were talking to complete tech-neophytes, like me! -- and how is it creating culture?**

What we do at Adafruit is kinda of like going to an amazing restaurant; the food is made with the best ingredients with the best chefs. At the end of the meal we give you a free cookbook on how to do this on your own and all the ingredients if you want to purchase them– we teach you how to make and create and share all our secrets. This seems like a very bad idea! Why give away all the secrets? Why teach people to cook when you can just have them come to the restaurant? Turns out giving away everything helps people learn and you become a trusted place for the things they need to learn more, so while that first dining experience was great, learning to make things on their own is better long term, it's a good cause and a good business. This is why it's disruptive– companies usually do not try to teach people things that at some point will decrease the opportunity for another type of sale.

**What does innovation mean to you?**

Bringing together as many different people to solve tough problem using technology to make the world a better place. If you can do that, in any way, big or small, you are innovating.

**What role does sustainability play in innovation, and in tech?**

If we can help people learn how to repair and building instead of just buy and throw away, we have a shot at making things more sustainable and keeping electronics out of the trash piles.

**What's the story behind your bright hot pink hair?**

I usually ask people what's their story for _not_ having bright hot pink hair! One the things I really enjoy is working for myself and expressing myself through my art, which is electronics. I think the young people who we are all trying to inspire need to see that it's totally possible to have a fun and amazing career in engineering and have pink hair and a lip ring.

**How do you find balance in life while running your own successful enterprise?**

Running a successful enterprise isn't about balance, it's a constant challenge and fight you can never give up on. You need to be obsessed, every single day. Usually this would be bonkers, but do not want to do anything else, it's never "work".

**What's next for you, in life and in your career?**

We're releasing our kid's show series every few months "Circuit Playground," to help younger folks get interested in electronics earlier.

Next up, we'll be launching [adafruit.io](http://adafruit.io/) soon. Here at Adafruit, we sell all of these amazing components, but we couldn't find a good way to interact with them over the internet. There are certainly a lot of great services out there for datalogging, or communicating with your microcontroller over the web, but these services are either too complicated to get started, or they aren't particularly fun to use. So, we decided to experiment with our own system, and that is how Adafruit IO got started.
