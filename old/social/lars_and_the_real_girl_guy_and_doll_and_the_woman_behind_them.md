**LOS ANGELES --** It was a 'what if?' thing," Nancy Oliver said one recent morning, explaining how she got the idea for her debut screenplay, "Lars and the Real Girl." "Like, 'What if we didn't treat our mentally ill people like animals? What if we brought kindness and compassion to the table?'"

Those soul-searching questions are perhaps not the ones that spring to mind when you consider the story of a man and his sex doll. When the movie begins, we meet Lars Lindstrom (Ryan Gosling), a churchgoing 27-year-old recluse so lonely that he purchases a life-size companion over the Internet. He promptly introduces it around town as Bianca, his half-Danish, half-Brazilian, wheelchair-using, missionary girlfriend.

If "Lars and the Real Girl" were an episode of "Six Feet Under," the twisty HBO series for which Oliver worked as a writer and co-producer for three years, the rest of the tale might have gotten its laughs and winces by showing what goes on in the bedroom between a troubled guy and a curvy, pouty-lipped woman who just happens to be made of flesh-toned silicone rubber. Instead the movie, directed by Craig Gillespie, takes an almost Capraesque turn: Everyone in Lars's gray, wintry town makes an "It's a Wonderful Life"-style group decision to support him by going along with his fantasy.

Until "Lars and the Real Girl" opens on Friday, it's anyone's guess if the marketing team at Sidney Kimmel Entertainment has persuasively communicated the movie's multilayered, perversion-averse nature. But judging from early reviews, there are film critics who are worried that people will never hear Oliver's humanistic message because of the prurient-sounding plot. "'Lars' might at first sound like a movie you wouldn't want your kids to see," is how The Hollywood Reporter put it, "but it has a heart of gold."

If a pal were to try to entice Oliver into meeting at the local cinema by reading that very sentence, though, it's likely that person would end up going alone.

"She's got this fiercely unsentimental thing," said Alan Ball, a close friend of Oliver's who, as the creator of "Six Feet Under" and "True Blood," HBO's new vampire soap opera that counts Oliver as a writer, has also been her boss. "Sometimes I'll call her and say, 'Hey, do you want to see this movie?' and she'll say: 'No. It sounds like it's going to be uplifting.' But if I say, 'There's this great French apocalyptic thriller where everyone gets blown up,' she's like, 'I'm in.'"

Oliver tried to reconcile her deeply felt characters with a taste in cinema that leans toward martial arts and action-adventure. "My feeble explanation," she said in her quiet, girlish voice, is that she uses so much emotion in her writing "that when I go see a movie, I can't go through that again. When I see things blow up, it's like candy. I feel better when I come out."

It was back in 1976 ("you do the addition," she joked when asked her age) that she and Ball, then both studying theater at Florida State University in Tallahassee, met and began collaborating. As founders of the satirical ensemble the General Nonsense Theater Company, the two wrote, starred in and helped stage subversive and biting comic sketches and, for a spell, performed in a nameless band with Oliver as the vocalist.

Ball, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of "American Beauty," who credits her with his decision to switch from acting to writing, spent years imploring his friend to move to Los Angeles. Instead Oliver stayed in Florida, where, she said, she supported herself by doing "anything anyone would pay me to do that was kind of mindless -- typing, filing, Xeroxing -- so I could save the rest for writing."

In 1997 Oliver finally made the move when a company she worked for -- Oliver was a writer-for-hire of an Internet game called Riana Rouge, about an abused secretary who is blasted into another dimension -- relocated to the West Coast. Not much later she accepted a gig as a script reader for Ball.

Oliver turned enigmatic when asked about the spark for "Lars." "I had a weird job that I can't talk about," she said, seated in a dark green booth at the Astro Family Restaurant here. "But I had to deal with a lot of Web sites and a lot of lonely guys." She did volunteer that after contemplating the concept for about five years, she wrote the script in a nine-month flurry in 2002.

The following year, after she had joined the "Six Feet Under" staff, her agent asked if she had any projects to shop around. Not much later, "Lars and the Real Girl" was ranked No. 3 on the 2005 edition of The Black List, a compilation of the Top 90 most-liked unproduced scripts in Hollywood.

By the time Gosling was cast, he said, Lars was more than just another role. "It was such a respected script," he said. "There was a certain level of fear on my part because whenever I'd mention it to people, there was always a 'don't ruin it' involved."

Last month, when "Lars and the Real Girl" had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival, the director and cast echoed that protective sentiment during the question-and-answer session, even beckoning the spiky-haired Oliver to the stage. But Oliver demurred, citing -- of all things -- her high heels. ("My shoes were so painful that I couldn't do much of anything," she said.)

Seated next to Ball during the film's screening, she was much more comfortable, ready to drive her friend crazy with whispered wisecracks. "Usually I annoy him by talking through movies," Oliver said. "But I didn't talk this time; we didn't even look at each other until the end of the movie.

"He had tears in his eyes, and I was starting to lose it," she said with a catch in her voice. "It was an incredible moment."
