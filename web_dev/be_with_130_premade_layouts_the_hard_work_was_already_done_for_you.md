## How to Edit a Pre-made Layout Quickly (1 click installation)

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dw0boQYXhn8), which takes about a minute of your time, and discover how you can install a pre-made layout and initiate the editing process _in about the same amount of time it took to watch the video_. It is really that easy!

The installation and editing processes seem to be happening at lightning speed, but you will find yourself creating pages at the very same pace in no time at all. Perform a design function once or twice, and you are well on your way to becoming an expert.

Furthermore, the tools you have to work with, like the **Admin Panel** and the **Layout Configurator**, keep track of your design efforts, so you never have to go back because you've lost track of where you are or what you did. Be Theme does that for you, as you move along a click at a time. The video offers just a small sampling of how easy this WordPress theme is to use.

Instead of receiving a quality product within the scheduled time, he will be getting an outstanding product in much less time than anticipated.
