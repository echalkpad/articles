MY older son, Matthew Ornstein, died at age 34 on Jan. 3 from carbon monoxide poisoning. It was accidental -- he fell asleep in a tent with a propane lantern -- but his death was shaped by a lack of judgment driven by a 10-year struggle with mental illness.

Matthew was a brilliant, warm, funny, compassionate and empathetic person. He was a national champion high school debater and celebrated standup comic who excelled in his studies at Princeton, then moved to Hollywood, where he and his debate partners created a sharp and witty show called "Master Debaters."

At age 24, Matthew had a sudden psychotic break, and that began a difficult decade-long journey for him and for his family and friends. Whatever his illness -- his condition was never formally diagnosed, but he probably suffered from bipolar disorder -- Matthew was particularly afflicted by one component of his illness: anosognosia, the inability of a person to recognize that he or she is ill. Since Matthew was over 18, neither family members nor professionals had any legal authority to get him treatment for the symptoms that kept him from living a stable life.

Matthew was not violent at all, and largely kept to himself. His appearance could be off-putting -- he kept a long beard, did not cut his hair and smoked heavily. We constantly feared that a police officer might misunderstand his condition and that he could end up injured or killed; we also at times prayed that he would get arrested and could have the happy ending that Pete Earley describes in his powerful book "Crazy," when a compassionate judge offered assisted outpatient treatment for his delusional son.

We tried everything to help Matthew, from acceptance and enabling to tough love, but the trajectory was not a good one and its ending has scarred and devastated our lives forever. I cannot say with certainty that if we had been able to force treatment on Matthew, including anti-psychotic medications, that he would have survived. In addition to suffering from anosognosia, Matthew became very religious after his break, embracing his Judaism, keeping kosher, and he was convinced that taking medication was dishonorable and would offend God.

But I do know that for many, treatment saves lives. The true insanity is that our laws leave those who suffer to fend for themselves. But Congress is now ready to grapple with the issue in a bipartisan bill introduced by Tim Murphy, a Republican from Pennsylvania and the only clinical psychologist in the House, and Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Democrat from Texas who is a psychiatric nurse.

The bill is not perfect. But it does many things to improve the financing, treatment and delivery of services across the range of mental illnesses, and in particular it has provisions aimed directly at helping those like my son.

Most critically, the Murphy-Johnson bill provides incentives to fund expanded treatment, called assisted outpatient treatment, or A.O.T., only for those with a long history and pattern of proving a danger to themselves or others. The specifics of A.O.T. vary by state, but judges can order patients to undergo treatment while they live in the community instead of in prison or a hospital. It has been proven to reduce crime by or against those with illnesses, as well as suicide. In some states, the treatment is ordered through the intervention of medical professionals or law enforcement; families do have to be involved. In many states, families can petition the court directly based on the likelihood that their loved one has a grave disability or condition.

But A.O.T. is not carte blanche: It still requires court action and has strict criteria to limit treatment to the most seriously ill. Five states, including Maryland, where my son spent most of his life, currently do not have such treatment; in those states that do, the options are often limited. The bill's provision is a carrot, not a stick, to encourage states to create or expand A.O.T. by providing bonus money in block grants for those that do.

The bill would also create a new position at the Department of Health and Human Services, an assistant secretary for mental health and substance abuse, and put the existing dysfunctional agency, known as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (Samhsa), under his or her supervision. Samhsa has used much of its budget to deal with less pernicious conditions like trauma and stress. It has also funded activist groups that oppose medication and mainstream psychiatric care for the seriously mentally ill.

The bill, which will soon be taken up by the full Energy and Commerce Committee, has broad support -- but not broad enough. A majority of the Democrats on the committee oppose the changes to Samhsa and vigorously oppose any move to assisted outpatient treatment. Their concerns are focused on civil liberties and are sincere but they come from failure to grasp the deeper traumas that can destroy lives. This bill does not return us to the time when we could easily lock someone up in a horrific asylum, and it balances the rights of patients with an opportunity for loved ones and professionals to help those incapable of helping themselves. The bill tries carefully to avoid coercive means and leaves protection to the courts to prevent or minimize abuses.

Nothing will bring back my son, and nothing can erase the pain of his loss. But action by Congress would help keep other parents and siblings from suffering as we have.
