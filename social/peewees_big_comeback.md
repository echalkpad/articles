aul Reubens wanted to show me his favorite Walgreens. I had asked to visit a place of personal significance, and although he has lived and worked in Los Angeles since the 1970s, he didn't plot some dutiful trip down memory lane -- a spin past the old headquarters of the Groundlings, the pioneering improv troupe where he created Pee-wee Herman, his indelible comic alter-ego; through the Burbank soundstages where he filmed much of ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure,'' the hit 1985 film that made him a star; up to his Hollywood Hills home, where he keeps an elaborate cactus garden and a stockpile of curios and tchotchkes. Instead, he proposed a pilgrimage to the Walgreens West Coast flagship. I laughed, but he wasn't kidding. A 23,500-square-foot behemoth at the corner of Sunset and Vine, the store is kitted out to the point of preposterousness with, among other things, a sushi bar, a supermarket, a florist, a warren of frozen-yogurt kiosks and a sidewalk cafe. As we entered, an employee handed out cups of sparkling wine. ''I love it here,'' Reubens said.

It was a midsummer afternoon, and he was taking a break from the editing of [''Pee-wee's Big Holiday,''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK3psQmIdnU) the first Pee-wee Herman movie in 28 years, which will have its premiere in March on Netflix. Reubens, who is 63, wore a nondescript outfit that struck a compromise between aging Angeleno scenester and high-school math teacher: looseÂ­fitting jeans bunched at the ankles; leather walking shoes; baggy black T-shirt; Casio calculator watch; large sunglasses that fit directly over his rimless eyeglasses. Reubens's hair was, like Pee-wee Herman's, buzzed short and, unlike Pee-wee's, graying in places.

We began our Walgreens tour in the vast liquor department, moving from there to its cosmetics aisles, where he took great pleasure in showing me that, in order to see the prices, you had to raise hinged cardboard panels, as if you were reading an enormous children's flap book. We lingered at a display devoted to ''As Seen on TV'' products, by far the most Pee-wee-ish part of the store. There were trompe l'oeil stretch pants made to resemble denim. There were fitted slip-on garments called Sleevey Wonders, designed for those who wished to wear sleeveless dresses while covering their arms. Reubens read aloud from another box with glee: ''Suzanne Somers's 3-Way Poncho!'' The three ways were ''professional,'' ''casual'' and ''dressy.'' At the Walgreens, it turned out, magic was everywhere.

One constant of Reubens's life has been his abiding affection for the inanimate. As a kid, born in Peekskill, N.Y., and reared in Sarasota, Fla., he showed his action figures great reverence, taking care never to leave them facedown between play sessions. Early in Pee-wee's existence, on nightclub stages and [in delirious David Letterman segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTzTKHEjW4Y), Reubens centered his routines on bags and boxes from which he plucked strange toys, perplexing inventions, novelty apparel and lovingly curated pieces (''A Batman credit card!'') of capitalist flotsam. ''I didn't have jokes, and I wasn't good at improvising,'' Reubens said. ''I was good at mugging and finding weird stuff.'' This continued on ''Pee-wee's Playhouse,'' Reubens's smash children's show, which ran on Saturday mornings for five seasons in the '80s and ranks as a work of auteurist genius to rival ''The Sopranos'' and ''Mad Men'' and other commonly feted -- not to mention more dour -- landmarks of scripted television. In the playhouse, anthropomorphized food cavorted inside Pee-wee's refrigerator, the armchair gave out hugs and even the windows and floors were puppets with plenty to say. During his down time, Reubens engaged in thrift-store binges he likened to acts of rescue, filling his house, and several storage lockers, with salvaged treasure. About a decade ago, he vowed to stop: ''I said, Maybe I can just get flat stuff that's easy to store, like postcards, so I bought those for about a week, and then I said, No. Enough.'' But he has broken this oath more than once, retaining a taste for bootleg and handmade Pee-wee souvenirs -- imperfect artifacts of strangers' love and of his once-epochal popularity.

Reubens's relationship to the success he achieved is, to put it mildly, conflicted; he's both deeply warm and deeply guarded, and even before his fame gave way to infamy after his [1991 arrest on charges of indecent exposure](http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/08/us/pee-wee-herman-enters-a-plea-of-no-contest.html), he weighed his ambition to reach ever-bigger audiences against the high premium he put on privacy. The decision to bring me to a chain drugstore was, in part, an act of deflection, but even so, our visit took a few autobiographical swerves. Leaving the Sleevey Wonders, we entered a section marked Wound Care. ''Where is it, where is it?'' Reubens asked, growing suddenly agitated as he scanned the shelves. ''Where's, um, like, stop-bleeding stuff?'' he asked a clerk, who led him to the right place. He snatched up a product called WoundSeal. ''This is stuff that my mom showed me, and as soon as she did, she cut herself, and I got to use it: You tear open this little packet, pour it on the cut and it stops immediately. So instead of going to the emergency room, or dying, you put this on.'' He flipped the box over to show me that, like Reubens himself, WoundSeal came from Sarasota. ''I have this in my car right now,'' he said.

Reubens drifted away from Wound Care and arrived at a rack of tourist junk: Walk of Fame shot glasses; vinyl Clippers purses. He considered these, then nodded upward, toward the fluorescent lights. ''There are apartments upstairs -- wouldn't it be amazing to live here?'' he said. ''You'd never have to leave.''

**Pee-wee is,** by now, a decades-old, decades-absent oddball, and yet he does not register as dated because Reubens designed him, from the jump, as untethered to any one moment in time. Arriving in the thick of the Reagan '80s, ''Playhouse'' offered a funhouse-mirror vision of the Eisenhower-era United States that Reubens grew up in -- its excess, its materialism, its hypocrisy, its racism, its hairstyles -- with an added slathering of Los Angeles punk. (Gary Panter, who designed the famous ''Playhouse'' set, used to draw for the fanzine Slash and made crude fliers for bands like Germs.) Reubens didn't attack '50s conventions, though, so much as revise and exaggerate them. ''I saw it as very Norman Rockwell,'' Reubens says, ''but it was _my_ Norman Rockwell version of the '50s, which was more all-inclusive.'' Actors of color dominated the cast, among them Laurence Fishburne and S. Epatha Merkerson. ''The King of Cartoons was black!'' Reubens says. ''Not just anybody. The king! That came out of growing up in Florida under segregation. I felt really good about that.''

''Playhouse'' flouted repressive ideas about sexuality too, in a sly way that still feels fresh. Almost from the moment Reubens became famous, cultural-studies scholars, feminist writers and queer theorists seized upon and celebrated this quality: In 1988 the academic journal Camera Obscura devoted a chunk of its May issue to essays analyzing Pee-wee. In The Village Voice 15 years later, the cultural critic [Richard Goldstein hailed Reubens](http://www.villagevoice.com/news/persecuting-pee-wee-6418453) as an emblem of ''anarchic queerness.'' One of the greatest achievements of ''Playhouse'' was that it created a place where desires are not policed, otherness is not demonized, gender roles are juggled and erotic energies attach where they will: Pterri the Pterodactyl ogles Miss Yvonne's breasts, Conky the robot enjoys a robot-nudie magazine, Pee-wee play-acts a date with Cowboy Curtis. In one ''Playhouse'' episode, a monster named Roger appears, scaring the Playhouse dwellers; Pee-wee fixes him a snack and strikes up a friendship. In another, Pee-wee loves a fruit salad so much he marries it, ceremony and all. Reubens told me, ''I've had so much feedback from people saying, 'I was so confused as a kid, and your show helped.' ''

Rewatching old episodes of ''Playhouse'' affirms Pee-wee's comic resilience. Reubens was ahead of his time in his breezily progressive handling of identity politics, which dominate the comedy we consider most relevant today, though his strategies were vastly different. On contemporary hits like, say, ''Broad City'' and ''Transparent,'' gender norms are explicitly and unapologetically assailed, whereas on ''Playhouse'' the sabotage was largely implicit. Because the show's more radical elements were refracted through -- and secreted within -- an upbeat, candy-colored atmosphere, ''Playhouse'' could be consumed and adored not only by those who ''got it'' but also by ''squares'' (not to mention their children, whom Pee-wee indoctrinated into a cult of extreme acceptance). Judd Apatow, who helped to shepherd ''Big Holiday'' into production, identifies this spirit, along with the ingenuity of Reubens's performance, as central to what he sees as Pee-wee's evergreen appeal, and to a new movie's viability. ''When I was younger, I didn't put my finger on why I liked Pee-wee so much -- it just made me laugh,'' he told me. ''But looking back, it's a group of strange people who are having a great time and being really nice to each other, and as a slightly weird kid I must have understood that. I liked watching someone so different whom the audience loved. The idea that unique people were getting applause, that the crowd was going crazy for Pee-wee, made me feel you didn't have to be the football-team quarterback.''

Reubens has been plotting Pee-wee's big comeback for years. He wrote several scripts, appeared as Pee-wee in stray television cameos and amassed nearly two million Twitter folÂ­lowers, for whom he posts pictures of gold-plated Slinkys and sleeping bags that resemble pizza. The most important step in this plan was the hit ''Pee-wee Herman Show,'' a stage production that Reubens mounted in Los Angeles in 2010, which led to a 10-week Broadway incarnation later that year. Reubens intended for these shows to drum up movie interest, and they did: Apatow saw a Los Angeles performance, and soon afterward he and Reubens formed a partnership.

 Nonetheless, Reubens's desire to return remains in some tension with his bunker mentality -- from the start, Pee-wee offered Reubens a way to transform into, and armor himself within, his own ventriloquist dummy; when Pee-wee grew popular enough to attract interviewers, Reubens often insisted on receiving them in character, and in the credits for Pee-wee projects the character was listed as played by ''Himself.'' The reason for this self-erasure, he explains, was that Pee-wee worked better if audiences believed he might be real, but the feint also let Reubens hide in plain sight. Between seasons of ''Playhouse'' -- by which point Pee-wee had hosted ''Saturday Night Live,'' appeared on the covers of Rolling Stone and Life and released ubiquitous merchandise (T-shirts, action figures, magnets, windsocks) plastered with his face -- Reubens took to growing his hair and wearing a goatee to go incognito: Peter Pan turned bus-stop drifter. ''I once went up to Steve Martin, whom I knew fairly well by that point, and said, 'Hey, Steve!' and he had no idea who I was,'' Reubens recalls. ''Finally he said, 'Wow, you're really lucky -- you can go around unrecognized.' ''

Which made what came next feel all the more catastrophic. In July 1991, police arrested Reubens at an adult movie theater in Sarasota, where he was visiting his parents, and charged him with indecent exposure. The media, titillated as ever by the gap between public image and private behavior, seized on Reubens's distinctly un-Pee-wee-ish mug shot: the stringy hair, scruffy chin and white gym shirt of his off-set disguise. The arrest's afterlife, in tabloids and late-night monologues, was toxic, and even though Reubens had already ceased production on ''Playhouse'' (he says he intended a break from show business), CBS killed the final weeks of reruns, adding to the sense that the scandal torpedoed his career. ''I don't have any feeling about it at all that I want to share,'' he told me when I brought up the arrest. ''I don't really think about it -- or I try not to.'' He paused. ''The only thing I'll say is that it was stupid not to do anything. I never spoke out. I just went and hid, and in hindsight -- I mean, that was my true response, but I don't think it was smart -- if I had to do it over again, I would figure out a way to get out there, talk about it, take control of it.'' When he disappeared, he took Pee-wee with him, camping out for a time at the New Jersey estate of the billionaire tobacco heiress Doris Duke, whom he'd befriended, and in the Hollywood Hills, among his funny things. (He has always denied the charges and entered a plea of no contest at the time to avoid trial.)

''Big Holiday'' represents, on some level, Reubens's attempt to refigure the events of 1991 once and for all as a mere footnote in Pee-wee's story, rather than its deflating coda. ''Part of the reason why I wanted to come back,'' he says, ''is that I didn't have a real good ending to my career.'' In the years since, he has delivered acclaimed supporting performances -- in the ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' movie, ''Murphy Brown,'' ''30 Rock'' and Ted Demme's ''Blow,'' among other projects -- but such work has felt minor compared with what he accomplished with Pee-wee, and a whiff of exile, self-imposed or otherwise, has long clung to Reubens. ''To be honest, there have been times when I've had a foot out of the business altogether, with no plans of continuing,'' he says.

''I think, for a while, it darkened him,'' Phyllis Katz, his old Groundlings instructor, says of the arrest's fallout. ''If you're an international star like he was, you have to keep a part of yourself for yourself -- and something like this makes people think, incorrectly, Oh, that's who he _really_ is.'' (This dynamic threatened to repeat itself in 2002, when Reubens was arrested on charges of possessing child pornography, which stemmed from his vast collection of vintage erotica and which were soon dismissed.) Certain artists might be tempted to explore and comment on such ordeals in their work, and there are moments when Reubens seems, obliquely, to do so. In his 2010 Pee-wee stage show, Mailman Mike reveals that he has been opening Pee-wee's correspondence -- ''It makes us all safer, Pee-wee,'' he explains creepily. When I asked Reubens how this connected to his own experience with the obliteration of privacy, though, he said he didn't even remember the line. Pee-wee is ''probably'' a means for Reubens to plumb the recesses of his soul, he said, but not in any way he copped to being conscious of: ''You'd have to ask a psychologist.''

**Reubens and Apatow** first floated the idea of a Pee-wee revival to Universal and Sony, where Apatow has strong relationships, but both studios passed. ''Meanwhile they remade every other thing from the '80s,'' Reubens says. ''It was hard to see them remake 'The A-Team' and 'Dukes of Hazzard' and '21 Jump Street,' while I kept getting 'No, no, no.' '' The script, which Reubens wrote with the young comedian Paul Rust, languished. ''I don't know why,'' Reubens says. ''But when Universal passed on it, 'Bridesmaids' '' -- another Apatow production -- ''was in theaters making a lot of money, and it was hard not to think, Well, they just don't like me.'' Discussing this studio reluctance, Apatow says, ''It's been a lot of years since there was a hit Pee-wee Herman movie -- but I always felt that, after the success of bringing back things like the Muppets and the Chipmunks, we'd be able to get somebody to make this movie.''

From Paul Reubens

That somebody turned out to be Netflix. The production arm of the content-streaming service has become a reliable home for well-pedigreed comedy reboots -- like ''Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp,'' the fourth season of ''Arrested Development'' and ''W/ Bob & David'' -- that might seem too offbeat for more traditional avenues of backing and distribution. The company remains relatively unproven in the feature-film category, however; John Lee, the director of ''Big Holiday,'' surmises that it was partly for this reason that Netflix approved a budget of just under $30 million, on par with comedy budgets at big studios. ''They wanted to be sure that they weren't cheap,'' Lee jokes. (A burly, 30ish guy, Lee grew up a Pee-wee fan and was a creator of the mid-aughts MTV comedy ''Wonder Showzen,'' a demented mock children's show -- far darker in its humor than ''Playhouse'' but with some Pee-wee in its DNA all the same.)

The movie they made is of a piece with other Pee-wee projects, each of which takes place in a world distinct from the others. In ''Big Adventure,'' Pee-wee lives in a suburban town and loves his bicycle; in ''Big-Top Pee-wee,'' he's a farmer in rural nowhere; in ''Playhouse,'' he inhabits a fantastical realm called Puppetland. The premise of ''Big Holiday'' is that Pee-wee, having suffered some unspecified trauma earlier in life, refuses to leave his hometown, where everyone knows and likes him. And yet he also feels inarticulably different from his fellow townspeople and yearns to escape. Pee-wee's stifled urge to bust out is dramaÂ­tized in a wonderfully bizarre opening dream sequence featuring a naked alien with six moist nostrils, and is ignited in his waking life when a motorcycle-riding hunk -- the actor Joe Manganiello, from ''True Blood'' and ''Magic Mike''-- rolls through town and inspires Pee-wee to embark on a cross-country pilgrimage. (If you wish to trace parallels here with the traumas, retrenchments and re-emergences in Reubens's career, they are available, but not belabored.)

Production on ''Big Holiday'' lasted 36 days. Last July, Reubens joined Lee and his editor, Jeff Buchanan, to fine-tune the scene in which Joe and Pee-wee first meet, at a diner. The two men bond over their shared fixation with the same uncommon candy (root-beer barrels), and Pee-wee makes Manganiello a milkshake. Decades in, Reubens retains his masterful, almost perverse, sense of comic timing. He distends certain beats you expect to whiz by, accelerates others you expect to linger and exerts precise control over his outsize character; his motions are clipped but surge with weird, spastic joy, and in the diner scene he makes a process as mundane as pouring milk over ice cream riveting. ''We trimmed down the shake-making,'' Lee told Reubens after the scene played through. ''You thought it was a little long. And we leaned on the two-shot more when you and Joe are in sync.'' Reubens told me that the root-beer-barrel motif is set up early in the movie: ''It's Pee-wee's favorite candy, and he has a little red-and-white straw that goes into the barrel. Then there's a red-and-white straw I put in the milkshake in this scene. Then later there's a dream sequence where Joe and I are jousting and our poles look like the straws.''
