A MESSAGE FROM OUR FOUNDER AND CEO -

![](http://www.softwar.net/images/100_0397.JPG)

Stupid has struck again and this time its target was the premier US law enforcement agency - the FBI. Hackers penetrated computers at the Department of Justice and reportedly swiped over 200GB of data, including names and addresses of employees at the FBI and Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The hackers have so far published information on 35,000 US government employees at DHS and the FBI. This first posting, if the hackers are to be believed, will be followed by others.

What makes this event so absurd are the very same agencies and authorities who have just lost the data for their own employees also continue to pursue a suicidal attempt to gain access to every phone and computer in America. It is their desire (and demand) that we all should adopt government approved software designs. The FBI, along with its counter-parts at DHS and the Dept. of Justice, have put extensive pressure on Congress and industry to build back doors and create special access to force Americans to give up their privacy - all in the name of security.

So the guys who couldn't secure their own database want access to yours. Sounds reasonable right? So, let's look at the recent history of our "state of the art" security.

This new hack comes on top of the 21.5 million US government employee records stolen from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The OPM hack included 5.6 million finger print records and the personnel files of employees at the NSA, CIA and FBI. The OPM hackers even stole the records of the FBI director. The result of the OPM hack was the US government, at great expense, is now providing financial monitoring coverage for the 21.5 million individuals who had their private information stolen. However, the OPM hack was not likely to be someone out to steal credit cards.

As a precaution, the US government has taken other steps because of the OPM hack to prevent damage to our national intelligence network. For example, the OPM hackers could have been the Chinese Army, so the US is reported to be quietly pulling its spies out of China. This precaution is based on the fact that an opposing intelligence operation could identify the individuals doing the spying based on the OPM records. It is not unlikely that similar withdrawals of US assets are taking place inside Russia, Iran and North Korea.

The other side of the OPM hack, the 5.6 million finger print records, is just as sticky. Clearly, opposing intelligence agencies could now identify individuals using the stolen data by their finger prints - which may explain the sudden withdrawal of our agents inside China.

Then there is the finger print lock problem. Access control devices based on "bio-metric" information such as finger prints are only as good as the equipment reading the metric. It is a fact that US police are already able to break finger-print locked cell phones using thumb prints extracted from suspects. So it's not that much of a leap that some foreign agency could fake a finger print and gain access to what's behind door number 3 .. Say at Los Alamos, Ft. Meade or even the J. Edgar Hoover Building.

All of this was followed by the recent case of the young man working for ISIS who hacked into the computers of a Department of Defense contractor. It was there the hacker extracted the names and home addresses of US military personnel, posting them on-line in an ISIS kill list. The ISIS kill list included many small town American cities, and things being so tight these days, the appropriate security precautions had to be taken else some nut-job acting out to get his name in the news might have blown away the family of a serving member who is doing a tour in Afghanistan.

Still, as bad at these hacks are, our security story regresses into the ridiculous with the other failures inside the halls of government. For example, the sudden loss of emails from the IRS during what appears to be a Nixon like revenge scandal designed to use the tax agency powers against political opponents. The question as to why this data suddenly disappeared is not nearly as bad as the how it managed to leave the material universe, ending up in the giant bit-bucket in the sky. The belated and contradictory explanations of how the IRS hard drive was eaten by a dog has left the most feared US government agency looking like a child trying to hide a crayon covered wall.

All of this comes on top of the ongoing Hillary Clinton email debacle with our ex-top diplomat using her own personal, unsecure, server to conduct official business. While there are many partisan points of view of the Clinton email disaster there is little question inside the US intelligence and computer security ranks that Vladimir Putin and President Xi of China were amused by the ease at which they could access her emails, including the 30,000 she deleted claiming they were not government business.

These apparent lackings are the result of criminal activity, some from outside the government and some from inside. The effortless nature of hacks into our leadership and the sudden loss of data that might imprison or embarrass the leadership, are just plain symptoms of poor security. Simply put: backups, audit trails and the liberal use of encryption could have prevented most of these events.

Yet, the FBI doesn't like encryption, as displayed by the lack of protection on their records. Why should they employ the very same security that they claim keeps them out of other people's business? After all, it clearly works. Oh right... that might seem bad for publicity since the mass media needs to have some FBI hysterical talking heads to blame encryption after every terrorist event.

In addition, government officials don't like audit trails and backups as well. This is because these operations leave too much information about possible failures on their part. Some of these failures include negligence, corruption, collusion, nepotism, and just plain stupid. So leaving evidence in the form of audit trails and backs ups might clean things up by putting a few people out of a job and perhaps even in jail. We certainly can't let that happen.

So don't expect a call for more encryption, backups and audit trails to stop the security leaks. Expect stupid. This is because none of those involved want the obvious solutions to be installed.

One if by Land, Two if By Sea,
