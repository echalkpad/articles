With that, he created two profiles, one with a photo of him rock climbing and the other of him playing guitar at a music gig. "Regardless of future plans, what's more interesting to you right now? Sex or love?" went one question. Answer: Love, obviously. But for the younger A cluster, he followed his computer's direction and rated the question "very important." For the B cluster, it was "mandatory."

When the last question was answered and ranked, he ran a search on OkCupid for women in Los Angeles sorted by match percentage. At the top: a page of women matched at 99 percent. He scrolled down ... and down ... and down. Ten thousand women scrolled by, from all over Los Angeles, and he was still in the 90s.

He needed one more step to get noticed. OkCupid members are notified when some­one views their pages, so he wrote a new program to visit the pages of his top-rated matches, cycling by age: a thousand 41-year-old women on Monday, another thousand 40-year-old women on Tuesday, looping back through when he reached 27-year-olds two weeks later. Women reciprocated by visiting his profiles, some 400 a day. And messages began to roll in.

"I haven't until now come across anyone with such winning numbers, AND I find your profile intriguing," one woman wrote. "Also, something about a rugged man who's really good with numbers ... Thought I'd say hi."

"Hey there--your profile really struck me and I wanted to say hi," another wrote. "I think we have quite a lot in common, maybe not the math but certainly a lot of other good stuff!"

"Can you really translate Chinese?" yet another asked. "I took a class briefly but it didn't go well."

The math portion of McKinlay's search was done. Only one thing remained. He'd have to leave his cubicle and take his research into the field. He'd have to go on dates.

<span class="lead-in">On June 30, McKinlay</span>

 showered at the UCLA gym and drove his beat-up Nissan across town for his first data-mined date. Sheila was a web designer from the A cluster of young artist types. They met for lunch at a cafe in Echo Park. "It was scary," McKinlay says. "Up until this point it had almost been an academic exercise."

By the end of his date with Sheila, it was clear to both that the attraction wasn't there. He went on his second date the next day--an attractive blog editor from the B cluster. He'd planned a romantic walk around Echo Park Lake but found it was being dredged. She'd been reading Proust and feeling down about her life. "It was kind of depressing," he says.

Date three was also from the B group. He met Alison at a bar in Koreatown. She was a screenwriting student with a tattoo of a Fibonacci spiral on her shoulder. McKinlay got drunk on Korean beer and woke up in his cubicle the next day with a painful hangover. He sent Alison a follow- up message on OkCupid, but she didn't write back.

The rejection stung, but he was still getting 20 messages a day. Dating with his computer-endowed profiles was a completely different game. He could ignore messages consisting of bad one-liners. He responded to the ones that showed a sense of humor or displayed something interesting in their bios. Back when he was the pursuer, he'd swapped three to five messages to get a single date. Now he'd send just one reply. "You seem really cool. Want to meet?"

By date 20, he noticed latent variables emerging. In the younger cluster, the women invariably had two or more tattoos and lived on the east side of Los Angeles. In the other, a disproportionate number owned midsize dogs that they adored.

His earliest dates were carefully planned. But as he worked feverishly through his queue, he resorted to casual afternoon meetups over lunch or coffee, often stacking two dates in a day. He developed a set of personal rules to get through his mara­thon love search. No more drinking, for one. End the date when it's over, don't let it trail off. And no concerts or movies. "Nothing where your attention is directed at a third object instead of each other," he says. "It's inefficient."

Love is a Data Field

McKinlay's code found that the women clustered into statistically identifiable groups who tended to answer their OkCupid survey questions in similar ways. One group, which he dubbed the Greens, were online dating newbies; another, the Samanthas, tended to be older and more adventuresome. Here's how each cluster answered four of the most popular questions.

The Questions

After a month of dating equally from both of his profiles, he decided he was spending too much time on the freeway reaching east-side women from the tattoo cluster. He deleted his A-group profile. His efficiency improved, but the results were the same. As summer drew to a close, he'd been on more than 55 dates, each one dutifully logged in a lab notebook. Only three had led to second dates; only one had led to a third.

Most unsuccessful daters confront self-esteem issues. For McKinlay it was worse. He had to question his calculations.

Then came the message from Christine Tien Wang, a 28-year-old artist and prison abolition activist. McKinlay had popped up in her search for 6-foot guys with blue eyes near UCLA, where she was pursuing her master's in fine arts. They were a 91 percent match.

He met her at the sculpture garden on campus. From there they walked to a college sushi joint. He felt it immediately. They talked about books, art, music. When she confessed that she'd made some tweaks to her profile before messaging him, he responded by telling her all about his love hacking. The whole story.

"I thought it was dark and cynical," she says. "I liked it."

It was first date number 88\. A second date followed, then a third. After two weeks they both suspended their OkCupid accounts.

<span class="lead-in">“I think that what I did</span>

 is just a slightly more algorithmic, large-scale, and machine-learning-based version of what everyone does on the site," McKinlay says. Everyone tries to create an optimal profile--he just had the data to engineer one.

It's one year after their first date, and McKinlay and Tien Wang have met me at the Westwood sushi bar where their relationship began. McKinlay has his PhD; he's teaching math and is now working on a postgraduate degree in music. Tien Wang was accepted into a one-year art fellowship in Qatar. She's in California to visit McKinlay. They've been staying connected on Skype, and she has returned for a couple of visits.

At my request, McKinlay has brought his lab notebook. Tien Wang hasn't seen it before today. It's page after page of formulas and equations in McKinlay's tight handwriting, ending in a neatly ordered list of women and dates, a few terse notes about each. Tien Wang leafs through it, laughing at some of the highlights. On August 24, she notices, he took two women to the same beach on the same day. "That's horrible," she says.

To Tien Wang, [McKinlay's OkCupid hacking](http://christophermckinlay.net) is a funny story to tell. But all the math and coding is merely prologue to their story together. The real hacking in a relationship comes after you meet. "People are much more complicated than their profiles," she says. "So the way we met was kind of superficial, but everything that happened after is not superficial at all. It's been cultivated through a lot of work."

"It's not like, we matched and therefore we have a great relationship," McKinlay agrees. "It was just a mechanism to put us in the same room. I was able to use OkCupid to find someone."

She bristles at that. "You didn't find me. I found you," she says, touching his elbow. McKinlay pauses to think, then admits she's right.

A week later Tien Wang is back in Qatar, and the couple is on one of their daily Skype calls when McKinlay pulls out a diamond ring and holds it up to the webcam. She says yes.

They're not entirely sure when they'll get married. There's research to be done to determine the optimal wedding day.
