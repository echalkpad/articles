Windows: We love Autohotkey for its ability to [automate keyboard tasks](http://lifehacker.com/5598693/the-best-time+saving-autohotkey-tricks-you-should-be-using). Mouse movements are another thing, though. Thankfully, MouseController is up to the task.

The app records your mouse's movements and clicks in real-time. This means that when you play it back, your cursor won't just teleport across the screen, but will actually move exactly the way you did. We've featured simpler programs [like Mouse Jiggler](http://lifehacker.com/5608374/mouse-jiggler-keeps-your-computer-awake-for-video-watching-reading) to do targeted tasks like keeping your screen on, but this app provides much more flexibility.
