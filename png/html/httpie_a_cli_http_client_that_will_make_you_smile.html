 <p>Good tools make great craftsmen. Just as a sculptor owns a range of different
chisels and hammers to remove the precise amount of marble at a time, we
programmers need a repertoire of little helpers that will take the mundane
tasks out of the way so we can focus on our art.</p>

<p>What makes a good programming tool? I say that it needs to be focused on doing
whatever it was designed to do <em>exceptionally well</em>. Just exactly what you
need, without compromises. There&#x2019;s a whole lot of other things different people
might expect from their tools and that&#x2019;s why there are so many.</p>

<p>Surely, the sculptor would be able to get the statue done with just a
one-size-fits-all chisel and hammer. It might be a bit rough, but still a
beautiful piece. But it would probably take ages to complete, with periods of
horrible frustration when carving the eyelids with a clearly inadequate tool.</p>

<p>If you&#x2019;re doing back-end web development, <a href="http://httpie.org/">httpie</a> might be
one of the tools that are just right for you.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p><strong>httpie</strong> is a command-line http client, much like cURL or wget. Written
entirely in Python (using
<a href="http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests</a> for the backend and
<a href="http://pygments.org/">pygments</a> for syntax highlighting), it&#x2019;s well portable
to many platforms, including the big three: Windows, Linux and OSX.</p>

<p>The first version was published by <a href="https://twitter.com/jkbrzt">Jakub Roztocil</a>
in 2012. And what really sets it apart is its user interface. It extends the
basic functions of curl or wget with things like pretty-printing and
syntax-highlighting that make all the difference. It recognises a few
most-commonly used formats, such as JSON and HTML and processes the output
accordingly. All that from the comfort of your terminal.</p>

<p>This is how it looks:</p>

<p><strong>httpie</strong> is open-source, distributed under the terms of the BSD licence.
Check out Jakub&#x2019;s <a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie">repository on Github</a> to
see the code and contribute!</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-get-it">Where do I get it?</h2>

<p>The easiest way to get <strong>httpie</strong> is from <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a>
using the following cross-platform command:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">pip install httpie</code></pre></figure>

<p>If you prefer using OS-level packaging instead, <strong>httpie</strong> is widely available
as a package in many Linux distros and <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> for OSX too.</p>

<p>Check out all your options in the <a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie#installation">project&#x2019;s
README</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works?</h2>

<p>The interface isn&#x2019;t the simplest &#x2014;&#x2014; the http protocol has many things that need
to be covered, after all. But the design is intuitive and it <em>makes sense</em> in a
way that you&#x2019;ll remember it the first time you look at it. See the synopsis of
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> command below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http OPTS] METHOD] URL REQUEST_ITEMS...]</code></pre></figure>

<p>The only mandatory argument is the <strong>URL</strong>. Optionally, you can choose the
method and provide several <em>request items</em> &#x2014;&#x2014; additional parameters for your
requests. These might include extra headers, POST data, URL parameters, form
fields and more. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">http</code> command also understands a variety of <code class="highlighter-rouge">--options</code>
that affect both how your request will and the response will be handled.</p>

<p>The most basic usage therefore looks like this (mind you, there&#x2019;s no <em>ie</em> at
the end of the command):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http http://radek.io/</code></pre></figure>

<p>The method falls back to <strong>GET</strong> by default, as you would probably expect, and
GitHub&#x2019;s servers will be serving you the content of my website shortly after.
The headers are printed out along with the response; pretty simple.</p>

<h2 id="more-examples">More examples</h2>

<p>This is great, but <strong>httpie</strong> can do a whole lot more. You&#x2019;ll appreciate the
convenience, particularly when sending requests slightly more elaborate than the
one above. Check out the following examples.</p>

<h4 id="url-parameters">URL parameters</h4>

<p>One of the things you can add to the request with <em>request items</em> are GET
parameters. Use two <em>equals</em> signs between the name of the parameter and its
value and httpie will take care of the rest.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http https://httpbin.org/get <p class="nv">foo</p>bar <p class="nv">wicked</p>witch</code></pre></figure>

<p>The above command will produce something like this:</p>

<figure>

 </a>
 <figcaption>

</figure>

<h4 id="post">POST</h4>

<p>When sending JSON data with a POST request, you can specify key-value parts of
the payload using a similar convention, but delimited with a single <em>equals</em>
sign. When preceded by a colon, the value is interpreted as a non-string,
allowing you to pass over numbers, arrays and even whole objects.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http POST https://httpbin.org/post <p class="nv">wicked</p>witch casts:<p class="s1">'["spells", "curses"]'</p> --json</code></pre></figure>

<p>Here&#x2019;s the output:</p>

<figure>

 </a>
 <figcaption>
 <strong>Example 2</strong>: Sending a JSON request using POST.
 </figcaption>
</figure>



<p>A colon on its own makes <strong>httpie</strong> interpret the particular <em>request item</em> as
an additional header, attaching it to the request.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http GET https://httpbin.org/headers User-Agent:<p class="s1">'Wicked Witch 1.0'</p></code></pre></figure>

<p>This is what I got in my terminal:</p>

<figure>

 </a>

<h4 id="authentication">Authentication</h4>

<p>One of the many options allows you to get past basic auth as follows:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash">http GET https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/wicked/witch -a wicked:witch</code></pre></figure>

<p>And here&#x2019;s the output:</p>

<figure>
 <a href="http://radek.io/assets/images/posts/httpie/basic-auth.png">

<p>This was of course just the tip of the iceberg. Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie/blob/master/README.rst">project&#x2019;s
README</a> or the
command&#x2019;s <code class="highlighter-rouge">--help</code> for more examples and detailed explanations.</p>



<p>Whether you need to automate parts of your workflow with a quick bash script or
test something while developing an API, <strong>httpie</strong> is a great addition to your
virtual toolbox. It can&#x2019;t really do much more than <code class="highlighter-rouge">curl</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">wget</code>, but it&#x2019;s a
whole lot nicer. Don&#x2019;t use a large hammer for the eyelids, give
<a href="https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie">httpie</a> a go!</p>
