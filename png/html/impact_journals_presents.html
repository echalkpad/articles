 <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>

 <h4>Magnitude
 of the problem
 </h4>
 <p>Cognitive
 decline is a major concern of the aging population, and Alzheimer's disease is
 the major cause of age-related cognitive decline, with approximately 5.4
 million American patients and 30 million affected globally [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_1">1</a>]. In the
 absence of effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are
 of great concern, with 13 million Americans and 160 million globally projected
 for 2050, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike
 several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer's disease prevalence is on the rise,
 which makes the need to develop effective prevention and treatment increasingly
 pressing. Recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause
 of death in the United States [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_2">2</a>], behind
 cardiovascular disease and cancer. Furthermore, it has been pointed out
 recently that women are at the epicenter of the Alzheimer's epidemic, with 65%
 of patients and 60% of caregivers being women [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_3">3</a>]. Indeed, a
 woman's chance of developing AD is now greater than her chance of developing
 breast cancer [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_4">4</a>].
 </p>
 <h4>Failure
 of monotherapeutics
 </h4>
 <p>Neurodegenerative
 disease therapeutics has been, arguably, the field of greatest failure of
 biomedical therapeutics development. Patients with acute illnesses such as
 infectious diseases, or with other chronic illnesses, such as cardiovascular
 disease, osteoporosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, and even cancer,
 have access to more effective therapeutic options than do patients with AD or
 other neurodegenerative diseases such as Lewy body dementia, frontotemporal
 lobar degeneration, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the case of
 Alzheimer's disease, there is not a single therapeutic that exerts anything
 beyond a marginal, unsustained symptomatic effect, with little or no effect on
 disease progression. Furthermore, in the past decade alone, hundreds of
 clinical trials have been conducted for AD, at an aggregate cost of billions of
 dollars, without success. This has led some to question whether the approach
 taken to drug development for AD is an optimal one.
 </p>
 <p>Therapeutic
 success for other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and
 HIV, has been improved through the use of combination therapies [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>]. In the case of AD and its predecessors, mild
 cognitive impairment (MCI) and subjective cognitive impairment (SCI),
 comprehensive combination therapies have not been explored. However, the past
 few decades of genetic and biochemical research have revealed an extensive
 network of molecular interactions involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that
 a network-based therapeutics approach, rather than a single target-based
 approach, may be feasible and potentially more effective for the treatment of
 cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease.
 </p>
 <h4>Preclinical
 studies
 </h4>
 <p>Extensive preclinical studies from
 numerous laboratories have identified multiple pathogenetic targets for
 potential intervention. These include, in addition to amyloid-&#x3B2; (A&#x3B2;) oligomers and tau, inflammatory mediators,
 apolipoproteins and lipid metabolism factors, hormonal mediators, trophic
 factors and their receptors, calcium regulatory pathways, axoplasmic transport
 machinery, neurotransmitters and their receptors, prion protein, and a host of
 other potential targets. However, one of the drawbacks of these preclinical
 studies is that many have implicated single pathways, and shown large effects
 of targeting one pathway, whereas in human studies, such approaches have not
 been borne out. There are several possible inferences from such discrepant
 results: first, it is possible that it will be necessary to target multiple
 pathways simultaneously in order to effect an improvement in symptoms and
 pathophysiology. Second, it is possible that targeting a single pathway will
 be sufficient, but that earlier intervention will be required. Third, it is
 possible that all of these seemingly disparate pathways will converge on a
 single critical pathway, so that either a single targeted therapy or a
 multi-component, multi-targeted approach may be effective. And fourth, of
 course it is possible that neither of these two types of approaches will be
 sufficient. It is worth noting, however, that it is possible that addressing
 multiple targets within the network underlying AD pathophysiology may be
 successful even when each target is affected in a relatively modest way; in
 other words, the effects of the various targets may be additive,
 multiplicative, or otherwise synergistic.
 </p>
 <p>Based
 on a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies, we have advanced a model in
 which AD results from an imbalance in endogenous plasticity signaling (Fig. 1),
 [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>-<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_9">9</a>], and in which the &#x3B2;-amyloid precursor
 protein (APP) is a mediator of such plasticity-related signaling. Thus the
 model suggests that AD is analogous to other chronic illnesses such as cancer,
 osteoporosis, and atherosclerosis. In the case of osteoporosis, osteoblastic
 signaling is chronically exceeded by osteoclastic signaling, resulting in an
 age-associated chronic illness featuring loss of bone. By analogy, in
 Alzheimer's disease, there is a fundamental, age-associated imbalance between
 the dynamically opposed physiological processes that mediate plasticity, i.e.,
 between synaptoblastic and synaptoclastic activity. This signaling involves
 physiological mediators of synaptic development, maintenance, repair, and
 remodeling, including APP, its derivative peptides, ApoE, and tau, and is
 modulated by all of the many disparate factors associated with Alzheimer's
 disease. Furthermore, just as for neoplasia, positive feedback selects and
 amplifies the disease process; however, whereas in oncogenesis, the positive
 feedback occurs at the cellular level, in Alzheimer's disease, the positive
 feedback occurs at the molecular species level, in the form of prionic loops [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_8">8</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_9">9</a>].

 processing of, and signaling by, APP. [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>].
 </p>
 </div>
 <p>In
 support of this model, the four peptides derived from the amyloidogenic
 processing of &#x3B2;-amyloid precursor protein (APP)&#x2014;sAPP&#x3B2;, A&#x3B2;, Jcasp, and C31&#x2014;have been shown to mediate neurite
 retraction, synaptic inhibition, caspase activation, and programmed cell death [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_6">6</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_10">10</a>-<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_12">12</a>]; whereas, in
 contrast, the two peptides derived from the non-amyloidogenic processing of
 APP&#x2014;sAPP&#x3B1; and &#x3B1;CTF&#x2014;mediate neurite extension,
 and inhibit A&#x3B2; production, caspase activation, and programmed cell
 death [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_13">13</a>-<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_15">15</a>]. Thus APP appears to function as a molecular switch,
 mediating plasticity-related processes, and AD is associated, whether causally
 or incidentally, with an increase in the ratio of the neurite-retractive
 peptides to the neurite-extending peptides. Reducing this ratio, whether by
 affecting BACE (&#x3B2;-site APP cleaving enzyme) or other cleavage of APP,
 appears to mitigate the AD severity [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_7">7</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_16">16</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_17">17</a>].
 </p>
 <p>Of particular interest for the development of a
 therapeutic program whose goal is to correct the hypothesized chronic
 synaptoblastic:synaptoclastic imbalance is the feedback mechanism: whereas
 homeostatic (negative) feedback is utilized by biological systems with single
 goal outcomes (e.g., serum pH) and no requirement for amplification, prionic
 loop (positive) feedback is utilized by biological systems with multi-goal
 outcomes and a requirement for rapid amplification (e.g., thrombus formation
 or, potentially, synapse modulation), and such systems therefore function as
 molecular switches [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_9">9</a>]. In these latter systems, the positive feedback
 feature of the systems dictates that the molecular mediators involved, or a
 subset thereof, beget more of themselves, or enhance their own activities. 
 Thus such amplifying systems are prionic, with the degree of infectivity
 depending on the stability of the molecular species involved. In the case of
 APP signaling, binding of a trophic ligand such as netrin-1 increases the
 production of sAPP&#x3B1; [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_18">18</a>], which inhibits BACE cleavage [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_19">19</a>], with the
 complementary fragment, &#x3B1;CTF, inhibiting &#x3B3;-secretase cleavage [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_14">14</a>]; thus cleavage
 at the &#x3B1;-site produces fragments that inhibit cleavage at the &#x3B2;-site and &#x3B3;-site rather than feeding back to reduce &#x3B1;-site cleavage. Similarly, cleavage at the &#x3B2;-site and &#x3B3;-site to produce A&#x3B2; feeds back
 positively to increase APP-C31 production [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_20">20</a>], thus favoring
 the pro-AD, anti-trophic processing of APP. Moreover, A&#x3B2; itself has been shown to exhibit prionic properties [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_21">21</a>], although the mechanism by which it does so has not
 been clarified.
 </p>
 <p>Thus APP processing displays positive
 feedback, and therefore APP and its derivative peptides function as a molecular
 switch. This has critical implications for therapeutic development, since it
 offers a mechanism by which a threshold effect occurs. We have taken advantage
 of this phenomenon to develop drug candidates that increase the anti-AD,
 trophic APP signaling, while reducing the pro-AD, anti-trophic APP signaling [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_22">22</a>] and enhancing
 cognition [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_23">23</a>].
 </p>
 <p>We
 have found that the manipulation of the plasticity balance that is mediated or
 reflected by the APP-derivative peptide balance (Fig. 1), whether genetically
 or pharmacologically, leads to predictable effects on learning and memory. 
 Mutation of the caspase site at Asp664 inhibits the synaptic loss, memory
 deficits, and dentate gyral atrophy that otherwise occurs in the PDAPP
 transgenic mouse model of AD [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_7">7</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_17">17</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_24">24</a>-<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_26">26</a>]. Furthermore, knock-in studies
 of a wild type mouse D664A support the notion that APP is indeed involved
 fundamentally in plasticity. (Kane, et al, unpublished data, 2014)
 </p>
 <h4>Systems
 biology and systems therapeutics of AD
 </h4>
 <p>The
 transgenic mouse studies suggest that APP signaling can be manipulated to
 inhibit AD pathophysiology. However, the mouse models feature mutations in APP
 or other familial AD-related genes such as presenilin-1, whereas the large
 majority of patients with AD suffer from sporadic AD, without an APP or PS1
 mutation (although the majority do express the &#x3B5;4 allele of
 ApoE). Given the many inputs to the APP signaling balance in humans (e.g.,
 estrogen, netrin-1, A&#x3B2;, etc.), and the minimal success with each of many
 potentially therapeutic agents (e.g., estrogen, melatonin, exercise, vitamin D,
 curcumin, <i>Ashwagandha</i>, etc.), the pathobiology of AD dictates a system
 or program rather than a single targeted agent. Successes with other chronic
 illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, neoplasia, and HIV support the
 efficacy of multiple-component systems. My colleague and I have recently
 described such a system for AD [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>]. The basic tenets for such a comprehensive
 therapeutic system are the following: 1)
 Just as for other chronic illnesses such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular
 disease, the goal is not simply to normalize metabolic parameters, but rather
 to optimize them. As an example, a serum homocysteine level of 12 &#x3BC;mol/l is considered to be within normal limits, but is well documented
 to be suboptimal [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_27">27</a>]. Similar
 arguments can be made for many other metabolic parameters.
 </p>
 <p>2)
 Based on the hypothesis that AD results from an imbalance in an extensive
 plasticity network, the therapy should address as many of the network
 components as possible, with the idea that a combination may create an effect
 that is more than the sum of the effects of many monotherapeutics [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p>3)
 Just as for other chronic illnesses such as osteoporosis, cancer, and
 cardiovascular disease, the underlying network features a threshold effect,
 such that, once enough of the network components have been impacted, the
 pathogenetic process would be halted or reversed. Therefore, even though it is
 not expected that most patients will be able to follow every single step of the
 protocol, as long as enough steps are followed to exceed the threshold, that
 should be sufficient.
 </p>
 <p>4)
 The approach is personalized, based on the contributory laboratory values
 affecting the plasticity network; and is computationally intensive, since many
 physiological data points are analyzed, interdependent network-component status
 is assessed, and many interventions are prioritized to determine the
 therapeutic program.
 </p>
 <p>5)
 The program is iterative, so that there is continued optimization over time.
 </p>
 <p>6)
 For each network component, the goal is to address it in as physiological a
 way, and as far upstream, as possible.
 </p>
 <h3>RESULTS

 <h3>CASE
 STUDIES
 </h3>
 <h4>Patient
 one: history
 </h4>
 <p>A
 67-year-old woman presented with two years of progressive memory loss. She
 held a demanding job that involved preparing analytical reports and traveling
 widely, but found herself no longer able to analyze data or prepare the
 reports, and therefore was forced to consider quitting her job. She noted that
 when she would read, by the time she reached the bottom of a page she would
 have to start at the top once again, since she was unable to remember the
 material she had just read. She was no longer able to remember numbers, and
 had to write down even 4-digit numbers to remember them. She also began to
 have trouble navigating on the road: even on familiar roads, she would become
 lost trying to figure out where to enter or exit the road. She also noticed that
 she would mix up the names of her pets, and forget where the light switches
 were in her home of years.
 </p>
 <p>Her mother had developed similar
 progressive cognitive decline beginning in her early 60s, had become severely
 demented, entered a nursing home, and died at approximately 80 years of age. 
 When the patient consulted her physician about her problems, she was told that
 she had the same problem her mother had had, and that there was nothing he
 could do about it. He wrote "memory problems" in her chart, and therefore the
 patient was turned down in her application for long-term care.
 </p>
 <p>After
 being informed that she had the same problem as her mother had had, she
 recalled the many years of her mother's decline in a nursing home. Knowing
 that there was still no effective treatment and subsequently losing the ability
 to purchase long-term care, she decided to commit suicide. She called a friend
 to commiserate, who suggested that she get on a plane and visit, and then
 referred her for evaluation.
 </p>
 <p>She
 began System 1.0 (Table 1), and was able to adhere to some but not all of the
 protocol components. Nonetheless, after three months she noted that all of her
 symptoms had abated: she was able to navigate without problems, remember
 telephone numbers without difficulty, prepare reports and do all of her work
 without difficulty, read and retain information, and, overall, she became
 asymptomatic. She noted that her memory was now better than it had been in
 many years. On one occasion, she developed an acute viral illness,
 discontinued the program, and noticed a decline, which reversed when she
 reinstated the program. Two and one-half years later, now age 70, she remains
 asymptomatic and continues to work full-time.
 </p>
 <h4>Patient
 one: therapeutic program
 </h4>
 <p>As
 noted above, and following an extended discussion of the components of the
 therapeutic program, the patient began on some but not all of the system: (1)
 she eliminated all simple carbohydrates, leading to a weight loss of 20 pounds;
 (2) she eliminated gluten and processed food from her diet, and increased
 vegetables, fruits, and non-farmed fish; (3) in order to reduce stress, she
 began yoga, and ultimately became a yoga instructor; (4) as a second measure to
 reduce the stress of her job, she began to meditate for 20 minutes twice per
 day; [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>] she took melatonin 0.5mg po qhs; (6) she increased her sleep from 4-5
 hours per night to 7-8 hours per night; (7) she took methylcobalamin 1mg each
 day; (8) she took vitamin D3 2000IU each day; (9) she took fish oil 2000mg each
 day; (10) she took CoQ<sub>10</sub> 200mg each day; (11) she optimized her oral
 hygiene using an electric flosser and electric toothbrush; (12) following
 discussion with her primary care provider, she reinstated HRT (hormone
 replacement therapy) that had been discontinued following the WHI report in
 2002; (13) she fasted for a minimum of 12 hours between dinner and breakfast,
 and for a minimum of three hours between dinner and bedtime; (14) she exercised
 for a minimum of 30 minutes, 4-6 days per week.

 <h4>Patient
 two: history
 </h4>
 <p>A
 69-year-old entrepreneur and professional man presented with 11 years of slowly
 progressive memory loss, which had accelerated over the past one or two years. 
 In 2002, at the age of 58, he had been unable to recall the combination of the
 lock on his locker, and he felt that this was out of the ordinary for him. In
 2003, he had FDG-PET (fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography), which
 was read as showing a pattern typical for early Alzheimer's disease, with
 reduced glucose utilization in the parietotemporal cortices bilaterally and
 left &gt; right temporal lobes, but preserved utilization in the frontal lobes,
 occipital cortices, and basal ganglia. In 2003, 2007, and 2013, he had
 quantitative neuropsychological testing, which showed a reduction in CVLT
 (California Verbal Learning Test) from 84%ile to 1%ile, a Stroop color test at
 16%ile, and auditory delayed memory at 13%ile. In 2013, he was found to be
 heterozygous for ApoE4 (3/4). He noted that he had progressive difficulty
 recognizing the faces at work (prosopagnosia), and had to have his assistants
 prompt him with the daily schedule. He also recalled an event during which he
 was several chapters into a book before he finally realized that it was a book
 he had read previously. In addition, he lost an ability he had had for most of
 his life: the ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head.
 </p>
 <p>He had a homocysteine of 18 &#x3BC;mol/l, CRP &lt;0.5mg/l, 25-OH
 cholecalciferol 28ng/ml, hemoglobin A1c 5.4%, serum zinc 78mcg/dl, serum copper
 120mcg/dl, ceru-loplasmin 25mg/dl, pregnenolone 6ng/dl, testosterone 610ng/dl,
 albumin:globulin ratio of 1.3, cholesterol 165mg/dl (on Lipitor), HDL 92, LDL
 64, triglyceride 47, AM cortisol 14mcg/dl, free T3 3.02pg/ml, free T4 1.27ng/l,
 TSH 0.58mIU/l, and BMI 24.9.
 </p>
 <p>He
 began on the therapeutic program, and after six months, his wife, co-workers,
 and he all noted improvement. He lost 10 pounds. He was able to recognize
 faces at work unlike before, was able to remember his daily schedule, and was
 able to function at work without difficulty. He was also noted to be quicker
 with his responses. His life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in
 his head, which he had lost during his progressive cognitive decline,
 returned. His wife pointed out that, although he had clearly shown
 improvement, the more striking effect was that he had been accelerating in his
 decline over the prior year or two, and this had been completely halted.
 </p>
 <h4>Patient
 two: therapeutic program
 </h4>
 <p>The patient began on the following parts
 of the overall therapeutic system: (1) he fasted for a minimum of
 three hours between dinner and bedtime, and for a minimum of 12 hours between
 dinner and breakfast; (2) he eliminated simple carbohydrates and processed
 foods from his diet; (3) he increased consumption of vegetables and fruits, and
 limited consumption of fish to non-farmed, and meat to occasional grass-fed
 beef or organic chicken; (4) he took probiotics; (5) he took coconut oil i tsp
 bid; (6) he exercised strenuously, swimming 3-4 times per week, cycling twice
 per week, and running once per week; (7) he took melatonin 0.5mg po qhs, and
 tried to sleep as close to 8 hours per night as his schedule would allow; (8)
 he took herbs <i>Bacopa monniera</i> 250mg, <i>Ashwagandha</i> 500mg, and
 turmeric 400mg each day; (9) he took methylcobalamin 1mg,
 methyltetrahydrofolate 0.8mg, and pyridoxine-5-phosphate 50mg each day; (10) he
 took citicoline 500mg po bid; (11) he took vitamin C 1g per day, vitamin D3
 5000IU per day, vitamin E 400IU per day, CoQ<sub>10</sub> 200mg per day, Zn
 picolinate 50mg per day, and &#x3B1;-lipoic acid 100mg per day; (12)
 he took DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) 320mg and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) 180mg
 per day.
 </p>
 <h4>Patient three: history
 </h4>
 <p>A 55-year-old attorney suffered progressively severe
 memory loss for four years. She accidentally left the stove on when she left
 her home on multiple occasions, and then returned, horrified to see that she
 had left it on once again. She would forget meetings, and agree to multiple
 meetings at the same time. Because of an inability to remember anything after
 a delay, she would record conversations, and she carried an iPad on which she
 took copious notes (but then forgot the password to unlock her iPad). She had
 been trying to learn Spanish as part of her job, but was unable to remember virtually
 anything new. She was unable to perform her job, and she sat her children down
 to explain to them that they could no longer take advantage of her poor memory,
 that instead they must understand that her memory loss was a serious problem. 
 Her children noted that she frequently became lost in mid-sentence, that she
 was slow with responses, and that she frequently asked if they had followed up
 on something she thought she had asked them to do, when in fact she had never
 asked them to do the tasks to which she referred.
 </p>
 <p>Her homocysteine was 9.8&#x3BC;mol/l, CRP
 0.16mg/l, 25-OH cholecalciferol 46ng/ml, hemoglobin A1c 5.3%, pregnenolone
 84ng/dl, DHEA 169ng/dl, estradiol 275pg/ml, progesterone 0.4ng/ml, insulin 2.7&#x3BC;IU/ml, AM cortisol 16.3mcg/dl, free T3 3.02pg/ml, free T4 1.32ng/l, and
 TSH 2.04mIU/l.
 </p>
 <p>After five months on the therapeutic program, she
 noted that she no longer needed her iPad for notes, and no longer needed to
 record conversations. She was able to work once again, was able to learn
 Spanish, and began to learn a new legal specialty. Her children noted that she
 no longer became lost in mid-sentence, no longer thought she had asked them to
 do something that she had not asked, and answered their questions with normal
 rapidity and memory.
 </p>
 <h4>Patient three: therapeutic program
 </h4>
 <p>She began on the following parts
 of the therapeutic system: (1) she fasted for a minimum of three hours between
 dinner and bedtime, and for a minimum of 12 hours between dinner and breakfast;
 (2) she eliminated simple carbohydrates and processed foods from her diet; (3) she increased consumption of
 vegetables and fruits, limited consumption of fish to non-farmed, and did not
 eat meat; (4) she exercised 4-5 times per week; (5) she took melatonin 0.5mg po
 qhs, and tried to sleep as close to 8 hours per night as her schedule would
 allow; (6) she tried to reduce stress in her life with meditation and
 relaxation; (7) she took methylcobalamin 1mg 4x/wk and pyridoxine-5-phosphate
 20mg each day; (8) she took citicoline 200mg each day; (9) she took vitamin D3
 2000IU per day and CoQ<sub>10</sub> 200mg per day; (10) she took DHA 700mg and
 EPA 500mg bid; (11) her primary care provider prescribed bioidentical estradiol
 with estriol (BIEST), and progesterone; (12) her primary care provider worked
 with her to reduce her bupropion from 150mg per day to 150mg 3x/wk.

 <h3>DISCUSSION
 </h3>
 <p>Results
 from the 10 patients reported here suggest that memory loss in patients with
 subjective cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and at least the
 early phase of Alzheimer's disease, may be reversed, and improvement sustained,
 with the therapeutic program described here. This is the first such
 demonstration. However, at the current time the results are anecdotal, and
 therefore a more extensive, controlled clinical trial is warranted.
 </p>
 <p>The
 results reported here are compatible with the notion that metabolic status
 represents a crucial, and readily manipulable, determinant of plasticity, and
 in particular of the abnormal balance of plasticity exhibited in SCI, MCI, and
 early AD. Furthermore, whereas the normalization of a single metabolic
 parameter, such as vitamin D3, may exert only a modest effect on pathogenesis,
 the optimization of a comprehensive set of parameters, which together form a
 functional network, may have a much more significant effect on pathogenesis and
 thus on function.
 </p>
 <p>The
 therapeutic system described in this report derives from basic studies of the
 role of APP signaling and proteolysis in plasticity, and the imbalance in this
 receptor proteolysis that reproducibly occurs in Alzheimer's disease. There
 are numerous physiological parameters that feed into this balance, such as
 hormones [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_28">28</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_29">29</a>], trophic
 factors [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_18">18</a>], glucose metabolism [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_30">30</a>], inflammatory
 mediators [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_31">31</a>], ApoE genetic status [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_32">32</a>] sleep-related factors [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_33">33</a>], exercise-related
 factors [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_34">34</a>], and many
 others; therefore, the therapeutic system is designed to reverse the
 self-reinforcing (i.e., prionic) signaling imbalance that we have hypothesized
 to mediate Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_8">8</a>].
 </p>
 <p>One
 potentially critical result from the study is the impact of the therapeutic
 program on the ability of the various patients to work effectively. Six of the
 10 patients had had to discontinue working or were struggling with their jobs
 at the time of presentation, and all were able to return to work or continue
 working with improved performance. One additional patient had not had
 difficulty at work at the time of presentation, and has continued to work
 without difficulty. The other three patients had not worked for years, and did
 not begin again after treatment. The improvement in function that is required
 to work effectively after struggling due to cognitive decline is an important
 outcome of any successful therapeutic system, and is ultimately more critical
 to the patients than biomarker effects or test performance.
 </p>
 <p>It
 is recognized that the system described here is an initial system, one that is
 likely to benefit from optimization. The system is designed to address
 multiple key pathogenetic mechanisms, but most of the key pathogenetic
 mechanisms are suboptimally affected by this initial system. This highlights
 multiple potential therapeutic targets, and optimizing the therapeutics for
 each of these targets is the goal of ongoing research and development.
 </p>
 <p>It
 is noteworthy that the major side effect of this therapeutic system is improved
 health and optimal BMI (body mass index), a result in stark contrast to
 monopharmaceutical treatments. However, the program is not easy to follow, and
 none of the patients followed the entire protocol. The significant diet and
 lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most
 common complaints of the patients. However, these complaints were mitigated by
 the fact that all of the patients had previously been made aware, either
 through their physicians or the media, that their prognosis was poor and their
 cognitive decline essentially untreatable.
 </p>
 <p>One
 potentially important application of the therapeutic program described herein
 is that such a therapeutic system may be useful as a platform on which drugs
 that would fail as monotherapeutics may succeed as key components of a
 therapeutic system. Combination therapeutics have proven successful in
 multiple chronic illnesses, such as HIV and cancer [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>].
 </p>
 <p>The
 positive results reported here are perhaps not surprising given that
 therapeutic programs have proven more effective than monotherapeutics in
 multiple chronic illnesses, such as atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,
 HIV, and cancer [<a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_5">5</a>, <a href="http://www.impactaging.com/papers/v6/n9/full/100690.html#bibl_35">35</a>]. Indeed, chronic illnesses may
 be more amenable to therapeutic systems than to monotherapeutics. However, the
 current, anecdotal results require a larger trial, not only to confirm or
 refute the results reported here, but also to address key questions raised, such
 as the degree of improvement that can be achieved routinely, how late in the
 course of cognitive decline reversal can be effected, whether such an approach
 may be effective in patients with familial Alzheimer's disease, and how long
 improvement can be sustained.
 </p>
 <h4>In summary:
 </h4>
 <p>&#x2022;A
 novel, comprehensive, and personalized therapeutic system is described that is
 based on the underlying pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The basic tenets
 for the development of this system are also described.
 </p>
 <p>&#x2022;Of the first 10 patients who utilized this program,
 including patients with memory loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD),
 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), or subjective cognitive impairment
 (SCI), nine showed subjective or objective improvement.
 </p>
 <p>&#x2022;One
 potentially important outcome is that all six of the patients whose cognitive
 decline had a major impact on job performance were able to return to work or
 continue working without difficulty.
 </p>
 <p>&#x2022;These
 anecdotal results suggest the need for a controlled clinical trial of the
 therapeutic program.
