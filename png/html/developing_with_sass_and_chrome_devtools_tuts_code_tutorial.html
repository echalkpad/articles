<div><div class="post-title-and-body__content"><p>In this article we'll take a look at how we can better integrate <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/">Chrome DevTools</a> into our <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> development workflow.</p>


<h2>Tutorial Sneak Peek!</h2>
<p>Here's a peek of what we'll be doing in this tutorial via an animated GIF:</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">

</figure>
<p>On the left is a terminal and the Sublime text editor, and on the right is Chrome. Changes to the <code>.scss</code> file are being persisted to disk, which is reflected in Sublime, the Sass watch command is generating a new version of a CSS file when it detects changes to the Sass file, which is in turn picked up by DevTools and reflected onto the page.</p>

<h2>The Need for a Better Workflow</h2>
<p>So what are we trying to solve here? Why would we want a better workflow? Well, let's review an example of debugging some Sass-generated CSS, given the following <code>.scss</code> file, which contains: </p>
<pre class="brush: css">
$myColor: green;

body {
	.box {
		color: $myColor;
	}
}</pre>
<p>And now the CSS, which is generated by the above Sass file, would look like this:</p>
<pre class="brush: css">
body .box {
 color: green; }</pre>
<p>Now we just need a little bit of HTML to apply our styling to:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;div class="box"&gt;Hello&lt;/div&gt;</pre>
<p>Ok, so far so good. Now we want to start designing and developing our page using Chrome DevTools. First we inspect the <code>div</code> with a class of <code>box</code> by right clicking on it and selecting <strong>Inspect Element</strong>. Then we can check out the styles pane, which shows a green value for the <code>color</code> property, a note on the filename it's contained within, along with the line number that the selector appears on. Now here's where the problem lies - the processed CSS does not follow, line for line, what the source <code>.scss</code> file looks like, which can have a negative impact on our development workflow.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sublime-source-vs-output.jpg" alt="sublime-source-vs-output" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32824"><br>
</figure>
<p>In the image above, the left pane shows a source <code>.scss</code> file and the right side shows the processed version. (Note I'm using the <a href="https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/tree/SublimeText2">SCSS bundle</a> for syntax highlighting in Sublime Text)</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/dev-tools-regular-view.jpg" alt="dev-tools-regular-view" width="435" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32811"><br>
</figure>
<p>DevTools then provides a link to the file and line number of the selector, highlighted in red above, which unsurprisingly links to the processed file (image below). This now acts as a limitation for editing the file within DevTools as we can't benefit from file saving. For example, if we persist changes to the processed file, they'll just be overwritten when Sass next runs.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't even have a clear indication of what the corresponding line number is - of course, practically speaking, our above example is very simple and we can very quickly understand what line maps to what, by looking at the code. However in a larger <code>.scss</code> file, things can get trickier.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">

</figure>
<p>As you can see above, DevTools has no understanding of our <code>.scss</code> file, we can address this however by utilizing a DevTools and Sass workflow, which is what we'll be looking at in this tutorial. To summarize, a lack of Sass support in the DevTools could mean: </p>
<ul>
<li>We don't immediately know the line number a selector and/or CSS property exists on, within our source file.</li>
<li>Persisting our CSS changes to the file system is pretty much out of the question.</li>
<li>Even simply viewing the <code>.scss</code> file in the sources panel is difficult as DevTools doesn't recognize the extension as one which should be viewed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preparing for Sass Support</h2>
<h3>Chrome</h3>
<div class="tip-shortcode">
<p><strong>Important: </strong> Sass support is an experimental feature. Please keep in mind that, while it has been around for a while now, things may change. If they do, we'll do our best to update this article, accordingly.</p>
</div>
<p>Now let's navigate to <code>about:flags</code> in the omnibox, then find <strong>Enable Developer Tools experiments</strong>, enable it and restart Chrome. </p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/chrome-flags.png" alt="chrome-flags" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32808"><br>
</figure>
<p>The image below shows an experiments panel, you can reach this by clicking on the cogwheel at the bottom right corner of DevTools and clicking '<strong>Experiments</strong>', then check the box for <strong>Support for Sass</strong>.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/dev-tools-experiments.png" alt="dev-tools-experiments" width="561" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32809"><br>
</figure>
<p>After closing and opening DevTools, you can now go to the <strong>General</strong> menu item in the left sidebar of the <strong>settings</strong> window and navigate to the <strong>Sources</strong> section, from there, check '<strong>Enable source maps</strong>' and '<strong>Auto-reload CSS upon Sass save</strong>'. The <strong>timeout</strong> can be left at the default value.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sass-support-dev-tools.png" alt="sass-support-dev-tools" width="571" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32819"><br>
</figure>
<h3>Sass</h3>
<p>This tutorial uses the latest version of Sass (3.3.0 at the current time of this writing) as there is some initial support for source maps. Here's how you can install Sass using Rubygems: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
gem install sass --pre</pre>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sass-gem.png" alt="sass-gem" width="339" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32815"><br>
</figure>
<p>We now need to tell Sass to compile our <code>.scss</code> files, using the following command: </p>
<pre class="brush: bash">
sass --watch --scss --sourcemap styles.scss:styles.css</pre>
<p>From above, the <code>styles.scss</code> is your source file and the <code>styles.css</code> is the processed file, which your HTML page would use. Here's how you would link in the processed <code>.css</code> file:</p>
<pre class="brush: html">
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css"&gt;</pre>
<p>If you see something similar to the image below in your terminal:</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sass-command-line.png" alt="sass-command-line" width="391" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32814"><br>
</figure>
<p>...and you see a generated <code>.map</code> file, then, congratulations: Sass debugging is working! Here's what those other command options are doing from the previous compile command:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><strong>--watch</strong></code>: Will watch for changes to the source <code>.scss</code> file and compile it as soon as it has detected a change.</li>
<li><code><strong>--scss</strong></code>: Will display what style of Sass we are using.</li>
<li><code><strong>--sourcemap</strong></code>: Will generate corresponding source map files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, having an understanding of source maps isn't critical to follow along, however it's certainly something worth reading about as it's intended to help the development process. See below for a few resources on source maps:</p>


<h2>From Elements to Sources</h2>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/1-elem-to-source.gif" alt="elem-to-source" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32806"><br>
</figure>
<p>Assuming all went well, opening up your page where Sass support is enabled in DevTools should allow for Sass debugging. The first thing to note is that the filename will show the corresponding <code>.scss</code> source file, which is useful, in addition to that, the line number correctly reflects the line number in our source file.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/elements-sass.png" alt="elements-sass" width="434" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32812"><br>
</figure>
<p>Clicking on the filename will take you right to the sources panel with the line corresponding to the selector in question highlighted.</p>
<div class="tip-shortcode">
<p>Note: You now have a viewable Sass file right in your browser with syntax highlighting!</p>
</div>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sources-panel-sass.jpg" alt="sources-panel-sass" width="457" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32821"><br>
</figure>
<p>Ok, so finding the corresponding CSS selector from the Elements panel is cool, but what about CSS properties? </p>
<p>In the screenshot below, the <strong>Sources</strong> panel has highlighted the CSS property I was interested in, to get there I had <strong>Command-Clicked</strong> on the property from within the <strong>Elements</strong> panel. The fact that it has taken me to the line where the value was defined (rather than the line: property: $value;) is very powerful! </p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sources-property-sass.jpg" alt="sources-property-sass" width="277" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32822"><br>
</figure>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=105285">Navigating to a CSS property</a> in the sources panel from command clicking the property in the Elements panel is not specific to Sass, it can be achieved with regular CSS too.</p>

<h2>Sass Editing With Persistent Changes</h2>
<p>Editing a Sass file is not much different than editing a regular CSS file, one thing we will need to do however is ensure DevTools knows where the <code>.scss</code> file is located at on the file system. From within the <strong>Sources</strong> panel, the left hand sidebar should have a <strong>Sources</strong> pane which displays the <code>.scss</code> file, right click it and choose <strong>Save as</strong>, then overwrite the existing <code>.scss</code> source file.</p>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/sources-save-as-sass.png" alt="sources-save-as-sass" width="523" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32823"><br>
</figure>
<p>Because we checked '<strong>Auto-reload CSS upon Sass save</strong>' and because Sass is running in the terminal with the <code>watch</code> flag, changes are made pretty quickly and the DevTools are able to show us those changes.</p>
<p>Even mixins work as expected, pasting the following, in an almost empty <code>.scss</code> file within the <strong>sources</strong> panel results in the correct CSS being generated, which DevTools is able to reload from within a second.</p>
<pre class="brush: css">
@mixin button {
 border: 2px solid green;
 display: inline-block;
 padding: 10px;
 border-radius: 4px; 
}

.box {
 @include button; 
}</pre>
<figure class="tutorial_image">
<img src="https://cdn.tutsplus.com/net/uploads/2013/06/mixin-sources.png" alt="mixin-sources" width="600" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-32813"><br>
</figure>
<p>As you can see in the image above, the left hand side shows the <code>.scss</code> source file, which is what we would make changes to, the right hand side shows the generated <code>.css</code> file which DevTools has picked up changes from (almost immediately thanks to the <code>watch</code> flag in the terminal)</p>

<h2>Sass Debugging at Fluent Conf</h2>
<p>Paul Irish gave a great talk at <a href="http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013">Fluent</a> which had lots of juicy information on the Chrome DevTools, but also the use of Sass. Skip ahead to <strong>5:30</strong> for the Sass information.</p>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqfoYaKCYUI?t=5m31s"></iframe></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Let's go over some of the main points discussed in this tutorial:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sass capabilities in Chrome DevTools are a great way to view and modify Sass resources, although don't forget to enable it in both <strong>about:flags</strong> and in the <strong>settings</strong> panel.</li>
<li>When using Sass and the Chrome DevTools in a project, you're likely to have a more efficient workflow with viewing/editing the source file, rather than the generated file.</li>
<li>CSS properties in the <strong>elements</strong> panel can be <strong>Command-clicked</strong>, the file name displayed to the right of the selector is also clickable. Both will take you to the relevant portion in the sources panel.</li>
<li>Utilize the <strong>Sources</strong> panel's editing capabilities by doing a '<strong>Save as</strong>' on the <code>.scss</code> file, future saves (<strong>Command+S</strong>) should overwrite the file.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html">Chrome Canary</a> and the latest version of Sass 3.3.0 (due to Source maps) were used in this tutorial, be sure to try them out!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Interesting links</h3>
<p>As you can see, the development workflow with Sass is not perfect, but it's definitely a lot better than what it used to be. As time goes on, DevTools will provide a more streamlined workflow for editing CSS files and bugs will be fixed!
