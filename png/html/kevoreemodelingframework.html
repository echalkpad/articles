<h2><a id="user-content-the-kevoree-modeling-framework-presentation" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/kevoree-modeling/framework#the-kevoree-modeling-framework-presentation"></a>The Kevoree Modeling Framework presentation</h2>

<p>The Kevoree Modeling Framework (KMF) started as a research project to create an alternative to the <a href="https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">Eclipse Modeling Framework</a> (EMF).
Like EMF, KMF is a modeling framework and code generation facility for building complex object-oriented applications based on structured data models.
While EMF was primarily designed to support design-time models, KMF is specifically designed to support the <a href="mailto:models@run.time">models@run.time</a> paradigm and targets runtime models.
Runtime models of complex systems usually have high requirements regarding memory usage, runtime performance, and thread safety.
KMF was specifically designed with this requirements in mind. </p>

<p>The border between large-scale data management systems and models is becoming less and less strict as <a href="mailto:models@run.time">models@run.time</a> progressively gains maturity through large-scale and distribution mechanisms.
Therefore, since its early days as an EMF alternative KMF evolved to a framework for efficient modeling (structuring), processing, and analyzing large-scale data.
It enables models with millions of elements, which no longer must fit completely into main memory, and supports the distribution of models over thousands of nodes.</p>

<p>KMF provides developers a powerful toolset to model, structure, and reason about complex data (during design- and runtime), while still being a 'lightweight' framework trying to introduce as less overhead as possible.
Advanced features like a notion of time, a native per object based versioning concept, distribution support, and easy-to-plug machine learning algorithms make KMF a powerful toolset for structuring, processing, and analyzing data.
A main focus of KMF is on performance and scalability, which are often neglected to a great extend by modeling frameworks. </p>

<p>KMF supports the definition of formal meta models (inspired by Ecore) with a simple DSL and generates, based on this meta model definition, the necessary facilities to create and manipulate business objects (runtime entities).
Code can be generated in different programming languages, currently we support Java and JavaScript. 
By using isomorphic models (models in different languages which use the same API) the same model can be used for example in a backend server and browser front-end. </p>

<p>For a more light-weight approach KMF also supports the definition of dynamic meta models, which can be defined and instantiated with a simple API - no formal definition and code generation step is necessary.</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-design-principles-and-features" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/kevoree-modeling/framework#design-principles-and-features"></a>Design Principles and Features</h2>

<p>As a main design principle KMF was from the beginning designed with strict memory usage, runtime performance, and thread safety requirements in mind.
KMF takes efficiency seriously. 
This includes implementing custom versions of internal core data structures, like hash maps and red-black trees backed by primitive arrays, to improve performance and memory usage.<br>
To cope at the same time with the large-scale, distributed, and constantly changing nature of modern applications the design of KMF combines ideas from reactive programming, peer-to-peer distribution, big data management, and machine learning.
The distributed aspect of many modern applications lead to the decision to design a completely asynchronous core for KMF. 
Models are defined as observable streams of chunks that are exchanged between nodes in a peer-to-peer manner. 
A lazy loading strategy allows to transparently access the complete virtual model from every node, although chunks are actually distributed across nodes.
Observers and automatic reloading of chunks enable a reactive programming style.</p>

<p>From a graph object (aka KObject), a classical operation consist in traversing the graph to collect related information. 
For instance from a node, a developer can reach subNodes and subSubNodes and so on. KMF offers two consistent and optimized APIs to perform such operations: </p>

<ul>
<li>KTraversal: typed, using the Java or JavaScript with a fluent API to declare the collecting behaviour. </li>
<li>Queries: untyped, using plain String an a pipe mechanism similar to UNIX pipe to declare collection and filter</li>
</ul>

<p>Un a nutshell, Queries are textual version of the KTraversal API</p>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-avoid-callback-hell-using-kdefer" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/kevoree-modeling/framework#avoid-callback-hell-using-kdefer"></a>Avoid callback hell using KDefer</h2>

<p>All KMF methods are build around the common asynchronous principle. This means that all results will be given in a KCallback closure (or anonymous function in javascript). Chaining severals operations or collecting severals KObject trough different method calls can leads to a huge nested hierarchy of callback. To avoid this callback hell effect KMF introduces an API named KDefer. In a nutshell, KDefer are barrier object than can be created on demand from the model and able to wait and collector several asynchronous results. The API is death simple, you create a KDefer object and then from it you can create various callbacks that you can inject in various query methods for instance.</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates the use of this API in Java code:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-java"><pre><span class="pl-smi">KDefer</span> myDefer <span class="pl-k">=</span> myModel<span class="pl-k">.</span>defer();
model<span class="pl-k">.</span>select(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>nodes[n=n1]<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, myDefer<span class="pl-k">.</span>waitResult());
model<span class="pl-k">.</span>select(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>nodes[n=n2]<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, myDefer<span class="pl-k">.</span>waitResult());</pre></div>

<p>and similarly in JavaScript:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-k">var</span> myDefer <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-smi">myModel</span>.<span class="pl-c1">defer</span>();
<span class="pl-smi">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">select</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>nodes[name=N1]<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-smi">myDefer</span>.<span class="pl-en">waitResult</span>());
<span class="pl-smi">model</span>.<span class="pl-c1">select</span>(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>nodes[name=N2]<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>, <span class="pl-smi">myDefer</span>.<span class="pl-en">waitResult</span>());</pre></div>

<p>Once all necessary callbacks have injected, you can end the KDefer by giving the final KCallback that will be called once all results are ready:</p>

<p>Here is the example in Java:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-java"><pre>myDefer<span class="pl-k">.</span>then(<span class="pl-k">new</span> KCallback&lt;<span class="pl-smi">KObject</span>[]&gt;{
 <span class="pl-k">void</span> on(<span class="pl-k">KObject</span>[] objects){
 objects[<span class="pl-c1">0</span>] <span class="pl-c">//contains objects with name N0</span>
 objects[<span class="pl-c1">1</span>] <span class="pl-c">//contains objects with name N1</span>
 };
});</pre></div>

<p>And similarly here is the example in JavaScript:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-js"><pre><span class="pl-smi">myDefer</span>.<span class="pl-en">then</span>(<span class="pl-k">function</span>(<span class="pl-smi">objects</span>){
 objects[<span class="pl-c1">0</span>] <span class="pl-c">//contains objects with name N0</span>
 objects[<span class="pl-c1">1</span>] <span class="pl-c">//contains objects with name N1</span>
});</pre></div>
