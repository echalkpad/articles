 <h3 id="what-is-tamper">What is Tamper?</h3>

<p>Tamper is a serialization protocol for categorical data. It achieves high compression ratios by finding the smallest possible binary representation for each category.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3>

<p>Take, for example, a boolean attribute. In na&#xEF;ve JSON we would represent this as a string, &#x201C;true&#x201D; or &#x201C;false&#x201D;:</p>

<p><code>
[{
 "guid" : 1,
 "edpick" : true
},
{
 "guid" : 1,
 "edpick" : false
}]
</code></p>

<p>Each value is 4-5 bytes; including punctuation <strong>27 bytes are required per item</strong>.</p>

<p>Tamper evaluates the data to find the most efficent encoding&#x2014;in this case, a <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/tamper/wiki/Packs/#bitmap-pack">BitmapPack</a>.</p>

<p>The data is serialized as <code>10</code>, <strong>just 0.25 bytes!</strong></p>

<p>Full details of Tamper&#x2019;s encoding scheme are in the <a href="https://github.com/NYTimes/tamper/wiki/Packs">protocol docs</a>.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-it-help-me">How can it help me?</h3>

<p>If you have a large set of objects that:</p>

<ul>
 <li>you want to transfer from server to browser</li>
 <li>have categorical attributes (i.e. with a distinct set of possibilities)</li>
 <li>have numeric ids (Tamper cannot pack string ids)</li>
</ul>

<p>Pourover can dramatically reduce the size of your data file, as well as time and memory required to serialize/deserialize.</p>



<h3 id="how-do-i-get-started">How do I get started?</h3>

<p>Tamper is intended as a companion to <a href="http://nytimes.github.io/pourover/">pourover.js</a>, but can be used independently.</p>

<h5 id="gzipped-json">gzipped JSON</h5>

<p>Gzip works by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE">writing backreferences to previous symbols</a>. Each time a symbol is repeated, gzip encodes the location and length of the backreference. These references are in turn compressed &#x2014; but in most real-world applications are larger than a direct binary encoding.</p>

<p>Additionally, conventional array-of-object JSON layouts sometimes generate backreferences at each attribute boundary. Because Tamper packs all values for an attribute in a fixed-width format, there is no attribute boundary overhead.</p>

<h5 id="google-protocol-buffers">Google Protocol Buffers</h5>

<p>Integer packs are similar in concept to Protocol Buffer <tt><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints">varints</a></tt>: integer size is dynamically scaled to fit the value rather than fixed at 32 bits. However, the minimum size of a varint is one byte; for many applications Tamper requires only 2-5 bits for each item.</p>

<p><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffers</a> are optimized for messaging details about a particular item; Tamper packs optimize for bulk categorical loads across many items.</p>
