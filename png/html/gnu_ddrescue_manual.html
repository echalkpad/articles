<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or
block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying to rescue the
good parts first in case of read errors.

 </p><p>The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic. That is, you don't
have to wait for an error, stop the program, restart it from a new
position, etc.

 </p><p>If you use the mapfile feature of ddrescue, the data is rescued very
efficiently, (only the needed blocks are read). Also you can interrupt
the rescue at any time and resume it later at the same point. The
mapfile is an essential part of ddrescue's effectiveness. Use it unless
you know what you are doing.

 </p><p>Ddrescue does not write zeros to the output when it finds bad sectors in
the input, and does not truncate the output file if not asked to. So,
every time you run it on the same output file, it tries to fill in the
gaps without wiping out the data already rescued.

 </p><p>Automatic merging of backups: If you have two or more damaged copies of
a file, cdrom, etc, and run ddrescue on all of them, one at a time, with
the same output file, you will probably obtain a complete and error-free
file. This is so because the probability of having the same area damaged
in all copies is low (if the errors are randomly located). Using the
mapfile, only the needed blocks are read from the second and successive
copies.

 </p><p>Ddrescue recommends lzip for compression of backups because the lzip
format is designed for long-term archiving and provides data recovery
capabilities which nicely complement those of ddrescue. (Ddrescue fills
unreadable sectors with data from other copies, while lziprecover
corrects corrupt sectors with data from other copies). If the cause of
file corruption is damaged media, the combination ddrescue + lziprecover
is the best option for recovering data from multiple damaged copies. 
See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#lziprecover_002dexample">lziprecover-example</a>, for an example.

 </p><p>Because ddrescue needs to read and write at random places, it only works
on seekable (random access) input and output files.

 </p><p>If your system supports it, ddrescue can use direct disc access to read
the input file, bypassing the kernel cache.

 </p><p>Ddrescue also features a "fill mode" able to selectively overwrite parts
of the output file, which has a number of interesting uses like wiping
data, marking bad areas or even, in some cases, "repair" damaged
sectors.

 </p><p>One of the great strengths of ddrescue is that it is interface-agnostic,
and so can be used for any kind of device supported by your kernel (ATA,
SATA, SCSI, old MFM drives, floppy discs, or even flash media cards like
SD).

<h2 class="chapter">2 Basic concepts</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Block</dt><dd>Any amount of data. A block is described by its starting position and
its size. The starting position (or beginning position) is the lowest
position in the block. The end of the block is its starting position
plus its size.

 <br></dd><dt>Cluster</dt><dd>Group of consecutive sectors read or written in one go.

 <br></dd><dt>Device</dt><dd>Piece of hardware containing data. Hard disc drives, cdrom drives, USB
pendrives, are devices. /dev/hda, /dev/sdb, are device names.

 <br></dd><dt>File</dt><dd>Files are named units of data which are stored by the operating system
for you to retrieve later by name. Devices and partitions are accessed
by means of their associated file names.

 <br></dd><dt>Partition</dt><dd>Every part in which a device is divided. A partition normally contains a
file system. /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb3, are partition names.

 <br></dd><dt>Recoverable formats</dt><dd>As ddrescue uses standard library functions to read data from the device
being rescued, only mountable device formats can be rescued with
ddrescue. CD-ROMs and DVDs can be mounted and they can be rescued,
"compact disc digital audio" CDs can't, "video CDs"[1] maybe.<br> [1]
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_CD

 <br></dd><dt>Rescue domain</dt><dd>Block or set of blocks to be acted upon (rescued, listed, etc). You can
define it with the options '<samp><p class="samp">--input-position</p></samp>', '<samp><p class="samp">--size</p></samp>' and
'<samp><p class="samp">--domain-mapfile</p></samp>'. The rescue domain defaults to the whole input
file or mapfile. If ddrescue can't determine the size of the input file,
the rescue domain defaults to the maximum size of a block (at least
2^63&#xA0;-&#xA0;1 bytes, or 8 EiB minus 1 byte).

 <p>Ddrescue will never try to read any data outside of the rescue domain
except when unaligned direct disc access is requested (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Direct-disc-access">Direct disc access</a>). If it does, please, report it as a bug.

 </p><p>The amount of data rescued, number of errors, etc, shown by ddrescue may
vary or even become zero if you limit the rescue domain. Don't worry,
they have not disappeared; they are simply out of the specified rescue
domain.

 <br></p></dd><dt>Sector</dt><dd>Hardware block. Smallest accessible amount of data on a device.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Using ddrescue safely</h2>

<p><a name="index-using-ddrescue-safely-3"></a>
Ddrescue is like any other power tool. You need to understand what it
does, and you need to understand some things about the machines it does
those things to, in order to use it safely.

 </p><p>Never try to rescue a r/w mounted partition. The resulting copy may be
useless. It is best that the device or partition to be rescued is not
mounted at all, not even read-only.

 </p><p>Never try to repair a file system on a drive with I/O errors; you will
probably lose even more data.

 </p><p>If you use a device or a partition as destination, any data stored there
will be overwritten.

 </p><p>Some systems may change device names on reboot (eg. udev enabled
systems). If you reboot, check the device names before restarting
ddrescue.

 </p><p>If you interrupt the rescue and then reboot, any partially copied
partitions should be hidden before allowing them to be touched by any
operating system that tries to mount and "fix" the partitions it sees.

<h2 class="chapter">4 Algorithm</h2>

<p><a name="index-algorithm-4"></a>
GNU ddrescue is not a derivative of dd, nor is related to dd in any way
except in that both can be used for copying data from one device to
another. The key difference is that ddrescue uses a sophisticated
algorithm to copy data from failing drives causing them as little
additional damage as possible.

 </p><p>Ddrescue manages efficiently the status of the rescue in progress and
tries to rescue the good parts first, scheduling reads inside bad (or
slow) areas for later. This maximizes the amount of data that can be
finally recovered from a failing drive.

 </p><p>The standard dd utility can be used to save data from a failing drive,
but it reads the data sequentially, which may wear out the drive without
rescuing anything if the errors are at the beginning of the drive.

 </p><p>Other programs read the data sequentially but switch to small size reads
when they find errors. This is a bad idea because it means spending more
time at error areas, damaging the surface, the heads and the drive
mechanics, instead of getting out of them as fast as possible. This
behavior reduces the chances of rescuing the remaining good data.

 </p><p>The algorithm of ddrescue is as follows (the user may interrupt the
process at any point, but be aware that a bad drive can block ddrescue
for a long time until the kernel gives up):

 </p><p>1) Optionally read a mapfile describing the status of a multi-part or
previously interrupted rescue. If no mapfile is specified or is empty or
does not exist, mark all the rescue domain as non-tried.

 </p><p>2) (First phase; Copying) Read the non-tried parts of the input file,
marking the failed blocks as non-trimmed and skipping beyond them. Skip
also beyond slow areas. The skipped areas are tried later in two
additional passes (before trimming), reversing the direction after each
pass until all the rescue domain is tried. The third pass is a sweeping
pass, with skipping disabled. (The purpose is to delimit large errors
fast, keep the mapfile small, and produce good starting points for
trimming). Only non-tried areas are read in large blocks. Trimming,
scraping and retrying are done sector by sector. Each sector is tried at
most two times; the first in this step as part of a large block read,
the second in one of the steps below as a single sector read.

 </p><p>3) (Second phase; Trimming) Trimming is done in one pass. For each
non-trimmed block, read forwards one sector at a time from the leading
edge of the block until a bad sector is found. Then read backwards one
sector at a time from the trailing edge of the block until a bad sector
is found. Then mark the bad sectors found (if any) as bad-sector, and
mark the rest of the block as non-scraped without trying to read it.

 </p><p>4) (Third phase; Scraping) Scrape together the data not recovered by the
copying or trimming phases. Scraping is done in one pass. Each
non-scraped block is read forwards, one sector at a time. Any bad
sectors found are marked as bad-sector.

 </p><p>5) (Fourth phase; Retrying) Optionally try to read again the bad sectors
until the specified number of retry passes is reached. The direction is
reversed after each pass. Every bad sector is tried only once in each
pass. Ddrescue can't know if a bad sector is unrecoverable or if it will
be eventually read after some retries.

 </p><p>6) Optionally write a mapfile for later use.

 </p>
The total error size (errsize) is the sum of the sizes of all the
bad-sector blocks. It increases during the trimming and scraping phases,
and may decrease during the retrying phase. Non-trimmed and non-scraped
blocks are not considered errors. Note that as ddrescue retries the
failed blocks, the good data found may divide them into smaller blocks,
decreasing the total error size but increasing the number of errors.

 <p>The '<samp><span class="samp">remaining time</span></samp>' is calculated using the average rate of the
last 60 seconds and does not take into account that some parts may be
excluded from the rescue (for example with '<samp><span class="samp">--no-trim</span></samp>'), or that
some areas may be unrecoverable. Therefore it may be very imprecise, may
vary widely during the rescue, and may show a non-zero value at the end
of the rescue. In particular it may go down to a few seconds at the end
of the first pass, just to grow to hours or days in the following
passes. Such is the nature of ddrescue; the good parts are usually
recovered fast, while the rest may take a long time.

 </p><p>The mapfile is periodically saved to disc, as well as when ddrescue
finishes or is interrupted. So in case of a crash you can resume the
rescue with little recopying. The interval between saves varies from 30
seconds to 5 minutes depending on mapfile size (larger mapfiles are
saved at longer intervals).

 </p><p>Also, the same mapfile can be used for multiple commands that copy
different areas of the input file, and for multiple recovery attempts
over different subsets. See this example:

</p><p class="noindent">Rescue the most important part of the disc first.
</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue -i0 -s50MiB /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -i0 -s1MiB -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Then rescue some key disc areas.
</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue -i30GiB -s10GiB /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -i230GiB -s5GiB /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Now rescue the rest (does not recopy what is already done).
</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -d -r3 /dev/hdc hdimage mapfile
</pre>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Invoking ddrescue</h2>

<p><a name="index-invoking-ddrescue-5"></a><a name="index-options-6"></a><a name="index-usage-7"></a><a name="index-version-8"></a>
The format for running ddrescue is:

</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue [<var>options</var>] <var>infile</var> <var>outfile</var> [<var>mapfile</var>]
</pre>
 <p><var>infile</var> and <var>outfile</var> may be files, devices or partitions. 
<var>mapfile</var> is a regular file and must be placed in an existing
directory. If <var>mapfile</var> does not exist, ddrescue will create it.

 </p><p>Always use a mapfile unless you know you won't need it. Without a
mapfile, ddrescue can't resume a rescue, only reinitiate it.

 </p><p>ddrescue supports the following options:

 </p><dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code></dt></dt><dd>Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-V</code><dt><code>--version</code></dt></dt><dd>Print the version number of ddrescue on the standard output and exit.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-a </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--min-read-rate=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Minimum read rate of good non-tried areas, in bytes per second. If the
read rate falls below this value, ddrescue will skip ahead a variable
amount depending on rate and error histories. The skipped blocks are
tried in additional passes (before trimming) where the minimum read rate
is divided by ten before each pass, until there are no more non-tried
blocks left.

 <p>If <var>bytes</var> is 0 (auto), the minimum read rate is recalculated for
each block as (average_rate&#xA0;/&#xA0;10). Values above device capabilities
are ignored.

 <br></p></dd><dt><code>-A</code><dt><code>--try-again</code></dt></dt><dd>Mark all non-trimmed and non-scraped blocks inside the rescue domain as
non-tried before beginning the rescue. Try this if the drive stops
responding and ddrescue immediately starts scraping failed blocks when
restarted. If '<samp><p class="samp">--retrim</p></samp>' is also specified, mark all failed blocks
inside the rescue domain as non-tried.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-b </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--sector-size=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Sector (hardware block) size of input device in bytes (usually 512 for
hard discs and 3.5" floppies, 1024 for 5.25" floppies, and 2048 for
cdroms). Defaults to 512.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-B</code><dt><code>--binary-prefixes</code></dt></dt><dd>Show units with binary prefixes (powers of 1024).<br>
SI prefixes (powers of 1000) are used by default. (See table below).

 <br></dd><dt><code>-c </code><var>sectors</var><dt><code>--cluster-size=</code><var>sectors</var></dt></dt><dd>Number of sectors to copy at a time. Defaults to 64&#xA0;KiB&#xA0;/&#xA0;sector_size. 
Try smaller values for slow drives. The number of sectors per track (18
or 9) is a good value for floppies.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-C</code><dt><code>--complete-only</code></dt></dt><dd>Limit rescue domain to the blocks listed in the <var>mapfile</var>. Do not
read new data beyond <var>mapfile</var> limits. This is useful when reading
from devices of undefined size (like raw devices), when the drive
returns an incorrect size, or when reading from a partial copy. It can
only be used after a first rescue attempt, possibly limited with the
'<samp><p class="samp">--size</p></samp>' option, has produced a complete <var>mapfile</var>.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-d</code><dt><code>--idirect</code></dt></dt><dd>Use direct disc access (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Direct-disc-access">Direct disc access</a>) to read from
<var>infile</var>, bypassing the kernel cache. (Opens the file with the
O_DIRECT flag). Sector size must be correctly set for this to work. Not
all systems support this.

 <p>If your system does not support direct disc access, ddrescue will warn
you. If the sector size is not correctly set, all reads will result in
errors and no data will be rescued.

 <br></p></dd><dt><code>-D</code><dt><code>--odirect</code></dt></dt><dd>Use direct disc access to write to <var>outfile</var>, bypassing the kernel
cache. (Opens the file with the O_DIRECT flag). Sector size must be
correctly set for this to work. Not all systems support this.

 <p>If your system does not support direct disc access, ddrescue will warn
you. If the sector size is not correctly set, a write error will result
and no data will be rescued. Some OSs have a bug that prevents them from
detecting write errors properly (or at all) on some devices if direct
disc access is not used for <var>outfile</var>.

 <br></p></dd><dt><code>-e [+]</code><var>n</var><dt><code>--max-errors=[+]</code><var>n</var></dt></dt><dd>Maximum number of error areas allowed before giving up. Defaults to
infinity. If <var>n</var> is preceded by '<samp></samp>' the number refers to new
error areas found in this run, not counting those already present in the
<var>mapfile</var>.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-E </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--max-error-rate=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Maximum rate of errors allowed before giving up, in bytes per second. 
Defaults to infinity. The rate being measured is that of actually failed
reads, so the rescue may finish because of this rate being exceeded even
if the total error size (errsize) does not change because the areas
being tried are being marked as non-trimmed or non-scraped, or are
already marked as errors.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-f</code><dt><code>--force</code></dt></dt><dd>Force overwrite of <var>outfile</var>. Needed when <var>outfile</var> is not a
regular file, but a device or partition. This option is just a safeguard
to prevent the inadvertent destruction of partitions, and is ignored for
regular files.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-F </code><var>types</var><dt><code>--fill-mode=</code><var>types</var></dt></dt><dd>Fill the blocks in <var>outfile</var> specified as any of <var>types</var> in
<var>mapfile</var>, with data read from <var>infile</var>. <var>types</var> contains
one or more of the status characters defined in the chapter Mapfile
structure (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Mapfile-structure">Mapfile structure</a>) and an optional '<samp></samp>' for
sector location data. See the chapter Fill mode (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Fill-mode">Fill mode</a>) for
a complete description of the fill mode.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-G</code><dt><code>--generate-mode</code></dt></dt><dd>Generate an approximate <var>mapfile</var> from the <var>infile</var> and
<var>outfile</var> of the original rescue run. Note that you must keep the
original offset between '<samp><p class="samp">--input-position</p></samp>' and
'<samp><p class="samp">--output-position</p></samp>' of the original rescue run. See the chapter
Generate mode (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Generate-mode">Generate mode</a>) for a complete description of the
generate mode.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-H </code><var>file</var><dt><code>--test-mode=</code><var>file</var></dt></dt><dd>Builds a map of good/bad blocks using the mapfile <var>file</var> and uses it
to simulate read errors in <var>infile</var>. The blocks marked as finished
in <var>file</var> will be read normally. All other block types will be
considered read errors without even trying to read them from
<var>infile</var>. This mode is an aid in improving the algorithm of ddrescue
and is also useful to verify that ddrescue produces accurate results in
presence of read errors. Use '<samp></samp>' as <var>file</var> to read from
standard input.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-i </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--input-position=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Starting position of the rescue domain in <var>infile</var>, in bytes. 
Defaults to 0. This is not the point from which ddrescue starts copying. 
(For example, if you pass the '<samp><p class="samp">--reverse</p></samp>' option to ddrescue, it
starts copying from the end of the rescue domain). In fill mode it
refers to a position in the <var>infile</var> of the original rescue run. See
the chapter Fill mode (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Fill-mode">Fill mode</a>) for details.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-I</code><dt><code>--verify-input-size</code></dt></dt><dd>Compare the size of <var>infile</var> with the size calculated from the list
of blocks contained in the <var>mapfile</var>, and exit with status 1 if they
differ. This is not enabled by default because the size of some devices
can't be known in advance and because the size derived from the
<var>mapfile</var> may be incomplete, for example after doing a partial
rescue.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-J</code><dt><code>--verify-on-error</code></dt></dt><dd>After every read error, read again the last good sector found and verify
that it returns the same data. Exit with status 2 if the read fails or
returns inconsistent data. This option performs one extra read after
each error, wearing the drive faster. Use it only on drives that stop
responding or return garbage data after finding errors. You may need to
power cycle the drive before restarting ddrescue.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-K [</code><var>initial</var><code>][,</code><var>max</var><code>]</code><dt><code>--skip-size=[</code><var>initial</var><code>][,</code><var>max</var><code>]</code></dt></dt><dd>Set limits to skip size during the copying phase. At least one of
<var>initial</var> or <var>max</var> must be specified. <var>initial</var> is the size
to skip on the first read error or slow read, in bytes. <var>max</var> is the
maximum size to skip. The values given will be rounded to the next
multiple of sector size. The skip size will be doubled for each read
error or slow read until it reaches <var>max</var> or, if <var>max</var> is
omitted, 1% of the size of <var>infile</var> or 1 GiB (whichever is smaller),
and will be reset to <var>initial</var> when good data is found. Valid values
range from 64 KiB to 1 GiB. <var>initial</var> defaults to 64 KiB. An
<var>initial</var> value of 0 disables skipping entirely.

 <p>If ddrescue is having difficulties skipping away from a large area with
scattered errors, or if the device has large error areas at regular
intervals, you can increase the initial skip size with this option. 
Inversely, if ddrescue is skipping too much, leaving large non-tried
areas behind each error (which will be read later in the usually slower
backwards direction), you can reduce the maximum skip size, or disable
skipping.

 </p><p>'<samp><span class="samp">--skip-size</span></samp>' is independent from '<samp><span class="samp">--cluster-size</span></samp>'. The size
to skip is calculated from the end of the block that just failed.

 <br></p></dd><dt><code>-L</code><dt><code>--loose-domain</code></dt></dt><dd>Accept an incomplete synthetic (user fabricated) domain mapfile or
test-mode mapfile and fill the gaps in the list of data blocks with
non-tried blocks. The blocks in the mapfile must be strictly ascending
and non-overlapping, but they do not need to be contiguous. This option
allows making quick edits to a mapfile without all the size calculations
involved in making all data blocks contiguous again.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-m </code><var>file</var><dt><code>--domain-mapfile=</code><var>file</var></dt></dt><dd>Restrict the rescue domain to the blocks marked as finished in the
mapfile <var>file</var>. This is useful for merging partially recovered
images of backups, or if the destination drive fails during the rescue. 
Use '<samp></samp>' as <var>file</var> to read from standard input.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-M</code><dt><code>--retrim</code></dt></dt><dd>Mark all failed blocks inside the rescue domain as non-trimmed before
beginning the rescue. The effect is similar to '<samp><p class="samp">--retry-passes=1</p></samp>',
but the bad sectors are tried in a different order, making perhaps
possible to rescue some of them.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-n</code><dt><code>--no-scrape</code></dt></dt><dd>Skip the scraping phase. Avoids spending a lot of time trying to rescue
the most difficult parts of the file.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-N</code><dt><code>--no-trim</code></dt></dt><dd>Skip the trimming phase. Specially useful in the first parts of a
multi-part rescue.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-o </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--output-position=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Starting position of the image of the rescue domain in <var>outfile</var>, in
bytes. Defaults to '<samp><p class="samp">--input-position</p></samp>'. The bytes below <var>bytes</var>
aren't touched if they exist and truncation is not requested. Else they
are set to 0.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-O</code><dt><code>--reopen-on-error</code></dt></dt><dd>Close <var>infile</var> and then reopen it after every read error and, if
'<samp><p class="samp">--min-read-rate</p></samp>' is set, after every slow read encountered both
during the copying phase. Use this option if you notice a permanent drop
in transfer rate after finding read errors or slow areas. But be warned
that most probably the slowing-down is intentionally caused by the
kernel in an attempt to increase the probability of reading data from
the device.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-p</code><dt><code>--preallocate</code></dt></dt><dd>Preallocate space on disc for <var>outfile</var>. Only space for regular
files can be preallocated. If preallocation succeeds, rescue will not
fail due to lack of free space on disc. If ddrescue can't determine the
size to preallocate, you may need to specify it with some combination of
the '<samp><p class="samp">--input-position</p></samp>', '<samp><p class="samp">--output-position</p></samp>', '<samp><p class="samp">--size</p></samp>',
and '<samp><p class="samp">--domain-mapfile</p></samp>' options.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-P[</code><var>lines</var><code>]</code><dt><code>--data-preview[=</code><var>lines</var><code>]</code></dt></dt><dd>Show <var>lines</var> lines of the latest data read in '<samp><p class="samp">16-byte&#xA0;hex&#xA0;+&#xA0;ASCII</p></samp>' format. Valid values for <var>lines</var> range from 1 to 32. If
<var>lines</var> is omitted, a default value of 3 is used.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-q</code><dt><code>--quiet</code></dt></dt><dd>Quiet operation. Suppress all messages.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-r </code><var>n</var><dt><code>--retry-passes=</code><var>n</var></dt></dt><dd>Exit after given number of retry passes. Defaults to 0. -1 means
infinity. Every bad sector is tried only once in each pass. To retry bad
sectors detected on a previous run, you must specify a non-zero number
of retry passes.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-R</code><dt><code>--reverse</code></dt></dt><dd>Reverse the direction of all passes (copying, trimming, scraping and
retrying). Every pass that is normally run forwards will now be run
backwards, and vice versa. '<samp><p class="samp">--reverse</p></samp>' does not modify the size of
the blocks copied during each phase, just the order in which they are
tried.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-s </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--size=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Maximum size of the rescue domain, in bytes. It limits the amount of
input data to be copied. If ddrescue can't determine the size of the
input file, you may need to specify it with this option. Note that this
option does not specify the size of the resulting <var>outfile</var>. For
example, the following command creates an <var>outfile</var> 300 bytes long,
but only writes data on the last 200 bytes:

 <pre class="example"> ddrescue -i 100 -s 200 infile outfile mapfile
</pre>
 <br></dd><dt><code>-S</code><dt><code>--sparse</code></dt></dt><dd>Use sparse writes for <var>outfile</var>. (The blocks of zeros are not
actually allocated on disc). May save a lot of disc space in some cases. 
Not all systems support this. Only regular files can be sparse.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-t</code><dt><code>--truncate</code></dt></dt><dd>Truncate <var>outfile</var> to zero size before writing to it. Only works for
regular files, not for drives or partitions.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-T </code><var>interval</var><dt><code>--timeout=</code><var>interval</var></dt></dt><dd>Maximum time since last successful read allowed before giving up. 
Defaults to infinity. <var>interval</var> is a rational number (like 1.5 or
1/2) optionally followed by one of '<samp></samp>', '<samp></samp>', '<samp></samp>' or
'<samp></samp>', meaning seconds, minutes, hours and days respectively. If no
unit is specified, it defaults to seconds.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-u</code><dt><code>--unidirectional</code></dt></dt><dd>Run all passes in the same direction. Forwards by default, or backwards
if the option '<samp><p class="samp">--reverse</p></samp>' is also given.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-v</code><dt><code>--verbose</code></dt></dt><dd>Verbose mode. Further -v's (up to 4) increase the verbosity level.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-w</code><dt><code>--ignore-write-errors</code></dt></dt><dd>Make fill mode ignore write errors. This is useful to avoid ddrescue
exiting because of new errors developing while wiping the good sectors
of a failing drive. Fill mode normally writes to <var>outfile</var> one
cluster at a time. With this option, after the first write error is
found in an area, the rest of that area is filled sector by sector.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-x </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--extend-outfile=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Extend the size of <var>outfile</var> to make it at least <var>bytes</var> long. 
If the size of <var>outfile</var> is already equal or longer than <var>bytes</var>
then this option does nothing. Use this option to guarantee a minimum
size for <var>outfile</var>. Only regular files can be extended.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-X</code><dt><code>--exit-on-error</code></dt></dt><dd>Exit after the first read error is encountered during the copying phase. 
This is similar but different to '<samp><p class="samp">--timeout=0</p></samp>', which waits until
the screen status is refreshed (at least 1 second). If there is at least
one successful read per second, '<samp><p class="samp">--timeout=0</p></samp>' does not make
ddrescue to exit.

 <p>This is also similar but different to '<samp><span class="samp">--max-errors=+0</span></samp>', which
exits when a new error area is found. If the read errors are adjacent to
existing error areas, no new error areas are produced (just enlarged),
and '<samp><span class="samp">--max-errors=+0</span></samp>' does not make ddrescue to exit.

 <br></p></dd><dt><code>-y</code><dt><code>--synchronous</code></dt></dt><dd>Use synchronous writes for <var>outfile</var>. (Issue a fsync call after
every write). May be useful when forcing the drive to remap its bad
sectors.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-1 </code><var>file</var><dt><code>--log-rates=</code><var>file</var></dt></dt><dd>Log rates and error sizes every second in <var>file</var>. If <var>file</var>
already exists, it will be overwritten. Every time the screen is updated
with new details, some of those details (time, input position, current
and average rates, number of errors and error size) are written to
<var>file</var> in a format usable by plotting utilities like gnuplot. This
allows a posterior analysis of the drive to see if it has any weak zones
(areas where the transfer rate drops well below the sustained average).

 <br></dd><dt><code>-2 </code><var>file</var><dt><code>--log-reads=</code><var>file</var></dt></dt><dd>Log all read operations in <var>file</var>. If <var>file</var> already exists, it
will be overwritten. Every read attempt and its result (position, size,
copied size and error size) is written to <var>file</var>. (The position
written is always the beginning of the block tried, even if reading
backwards). A line is also written at the beginning of each phase
(copying, trimming, scraping and retrying). Finally, a line with a time
mark is written every second (unless the read takes more time). Use this
option with caution because <var>file</var> may become very large very
quickly. Use lzip to compress <var>file</var> if you need to store or
transmit it.

 <br></dd><dt><code>--ask</code></dt><dd>Ask for user confirmation before starting the copy. If the first letter
of the answer is '<samp></samp>', ddrescue starts copying. Else it exits with
status 1.<br>
If they can be obtained, ddrescue shows the model and serial number of
the input and output devices. Else it shows the size in bytes of the
corresponding file or device.

 <br></dd><dt><code>--cpass=</code><var>n</var><code>[,</code><var>n</var><code>]</code></dt><dd>Select what pass(es) to run during the copying phase. Valid values for
<var>n</var> range from 0 to 3. '<samp><p class="samp">--cpass=0</p></samp>' skips the copying phase
entirely. To run only the given pass(es), specify also '<samp><p class="samp">--no-trim</p></samp>'
and '<samp><p class="samp">--no-scrape</p></samp>'.

 <br></dd><dt><code>--max-read-rate=</code><var>bytes</var></dt><dd>Maximum read rate, in bytes per second. If <var>bytes</var> is too small, the
actual read rate is rounded up to the equivalent of a whole number of
cluster reads per second. Use this option to limit the bandwidth used by
ddrescue, for example when recovering over a network.

 <br></dd><dt><code>--pause=</code><var>interval</var></dt><dd>Time to wait between passes. Defaults to 0. <var>interval</var> is formatted
as in the option '<samp><p class="samp">--timeout</p></samp>' above.

 </dd></dl>

 <p>Numbers given as arguments to options (positions, sizes, rates, etc) may
be expressed as decimal, hexadecimal or octal values (using the same
syntax as integer constants in C++), and may be followed by a multiplier
and an optional '<samp><span class="samp">B</span></samp>' for "byte".

<h2 class="chapter">6 Mapfile structure</h2>

<p><a name="index-mapfile-structure-9"></a>
NOTE: In versions of ddrescue prior to 1.20 the mapfile was called
'<samp><span class="samp">logfile</span></samp>'. The format is the same; only the name has changed.

 </p><p>The mapfile is a text file easy to read and edit. It is formed by three
parts, the heading comments, the status line, and the list of data
blocks. Any line beginning with '<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>' is a comment line.

 </p><p>The heading comments contain the version of ddrescue or ddrescuelog that
created the mapfile, the command line used, and the time when the
program started. If the mapfile was created by ddrescue it will also
contain the current time when the mapfile was saved and a copy of the
status message from the screen describing the operation being performed
(copying, trimming, finished, etc). They are intended as information for
the user.

 </p><p>The first non-comment line is the status line. It contains a
non-negative integer and a status character. The integer is the position
being tried in the input file. (The beginning of the block being tried
in a forward pass or the end of the block in a backward pass). The
status character is one of these:

 </p><table summary=""><tr><td valign="top">Character </td><td valign="top">Meaning
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'?' </td><td valign="top">copying non-tried blocks
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'*' </td><td valign="top">trimming non-trimmed blocks
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'/' </td><td valign="top">scraping non-scraped blocks
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'-' </td><td valign="top">retrying bad sectors

<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'G' </td><td valign="top">generating approximate mapfile
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'+' </td><td valign="top">finished
 <br></td></tr></table>

 <p>The blocks in the list of data blocks must be contiguous and
non-overlapping.

 </p><p>Every line in the list of data blocks describes a block of data. It
contains 2 non-negative integers and a status character. The first
integer is the starting position of the block in the input file, the
second integer is the size (in bytes) of the block. The status character
is one of these:

 </p><table summary=""><tr><td valign="top">Character </td><td valign="top">Meaning
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'?' </td><td valign="top">non-tried block
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'*' </td><td valign="top">failed block non-trimmed
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'/' </td><td valign="top">failed block non-scraped
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'-' </td><td valign="top">failed block bad-sector(s)
<br></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">'+' </td><td valign="top">finished block
 <br></td></tr></table>

<h2 class="chapter">7 Saving the mapfile in case of trouble</h2>

<p><a name="index-emergency-save-10"></a>
The mapfile is an essential part of ddrescue's effectiveness. Without a
mapfile, ddrescue can't resume a rescue, only reinitiate it. Given that
a difficult rescue may take days to complete, it would be a serious
drawback if the mapfile were lost because of a solvable problem like a
lack of space on the device the mapfile is written to.

 </p><p>In case of trouble writing the mapfile, ddrescue will print a message
like this:

</p><pre class="example"> Error writing mapfile '<var>mapfile</var>': No space left on device
 Fix the problem and press ENTER to retry,
 or E+ENTER for an emergency save and exit,
 or Q+ENTER to abort.
</pre>
 <p>You may try to fix the problem, for example deleting some files to make
room for the mapfile, and press &lt;Return&gt; to retry.

 </p><p>If the problem can't be fixed, you may press &lt;e&gt; followed by
&lt;Return&gt; to try an emergency save and exit. Ddrescue will try to
write the mapfile to the file <samp><span class="file">ddrescue.map</span></samp> in the current
directory or, if this fails, to <samp><span class="file">$HOME/ddrescue.map</span></samp>. If the
mapfile is written succesfully, ddrescue will exit with status 1. Else
it will print the above message again.

 </p><p>Or you may press &lt;q&gt; followed by &lt;Return&gt; to quit and exit with
status 1. In this case the contents of the mapfile will be lost.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Copying CD-ROMs and DVDs</h2>

<p><a name="index-optical-media-11"></a>
Ddrescue may be better than dd for copying recordable CD-ROMs because
the two lead out sectors at the end of some of them may cause a read
error that prevents the whole last record from being copied by dd,
potentially losing data. Also dd may create an image larger than the
original if the '<samp><span class="samp">sync</span></samp>' conversion and a block size larger than the
sector size are specified.

 </p><p>Recordable CD and DVD media keep their data only for a finite time
(typically for some years). After that time, data loss develops slowly
with read errors growing from the outer media region towards the inside. 
Just make two (or more) copies of every important CD-ROM/DVD you burn so
that you can later recover them with ddrescue.

 </p><p>If you have only one copy of a CD-ROM or DVD that fails when being
copied, and if you have access to multiple optical media drives, you
have a better chance of recovering the bad sectors since one drive may
fail to read a particular sector, but another drive might be able to
squeeze the data out of it, depending on the laser frequency and the
sensitivity of the laser-sensor that reads the reflected laser light.

 </p>
Example 1: Rescue a CD-ROM in /dev/cdrom.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 (if errsize is zero, cdimage now contains a complete image of the
 CD-ROM and you can write it to a blank CD-ROM)
</pre>
 
Example 2: Rescue a CD-ROM in /dev/cdrom from two copies.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -d -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 (insert second copy in the CD drive)
 ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 (if errsize is zero, cdimage now contains a complete image of the
 CD-ROM and you can write it to a blank CD-ROM)
</pre>
 
Example 3: Rescue a CD-ROM in /dev/cdrom using two CD drives from two
different computers, writing the image into an USB drive nounted on
/mnt/mem.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -n -b2048 /dev/cdrom /mnt/mem/cdimage /mnt/mem/mapfile
 ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom /mnt/mem/cdimage /mnt/mem/mapfile
 (umount the USB drive and move both USB drive and CD-ROM to second
 computer)
 ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom /mnt/mem/cdimage /mnt/mem/mapfile
 (if errsize is zero, /mnt/mem/cdimage now contains a complete image
 of the CD-ROM and you can write it to a blank CD-ROM)
</pre>
 
Example 4: Merge the partially recovered images of 3 identical DVDs
using their mapfiles as domain mapfiles.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -m mapfile1 dvdimage1 dvdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -m mapfile2 dvdimage2 dvdimage mapfile
 ddrescue -m mapfile3 dvdimage3 dvdimage mapfile
 (if errsize is zero, dvdimage now contains a complete image of the
 DVD and you can write it to a blank DVD)
</pre>
 
<a name="lziprecover_002dexample"></a>Example 5: Rescue a lzip compressed backup from two copies on CD-ROM
with error-checked merging of copies. 
(See the
<a href="http://www.nongnu.org/lzip/manual/lziprecover_manual.html">lziprecover manual</a>
for details about lziprecover).

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -d -r1 -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage1 mapfile1

<h2 class="chapter">9 A small tutorial with examples</h2>

<p><a name="index-examples-12"></a>
This tutorial is for those already able to use the dd command. If you
don't know what dd is, better search the net for some introductory
material about dd and GNU ddrescue first.

 </p><p>A failing drive tends to develop more and more errors as time passes. 
Because of this, you should rescue the data from a drive as soon as you
notice the first error. Be diligent because every time a physically
damaged drive powers up and is able to output some data, it may be the
very last time that it ever will.

 </p><p>You should make a copy of the failing drive with ddrescue, and then try
to repair the copy. If your data is really important, use the first copy
as a master for a second copy, and try to repair the second copy. If
something goes wrong, you have the master intact to try again.

 </p><p>If you are trying to rescue a whole partition, first repair the copy
with e2fsck or some other tool appropriate for the type of partition you
are trying to rescue, then mount the repaired copy somewhere and try to
recover the files in it.

 </p><p>If the drive is so damaged that the file system in the rescued partition
can't be repaired or mounted, you will have to browse the rescued data
with an hex editor and extract the desired parts by hand or use a file
recovery tool like photorec.

 </p><p>If the partition table is damaged, you may try to rescue the whole disc,
then try to repair the partition table and the partitions on the copy.

 </p><p>If the damaged drive is not listed in /dev, then you cannot rescue it. 
At least not with ddrescue.

 </p><p>See <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Optical-media">Optical media</a>, for rescue examples of CD-ROMs and DVDs.

 </p>
Example 1: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb.<br>
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 fdisk /dev/hdb
 e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb1
 e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb2
</pre>
 
Example 2: Rescue an ext2 partition in /dev/hda2 to /dev/hdb2.<br>
Note: you need to create the hdb2 partition with fdisk first. hdb2
should be of appropriate type and size.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 mapfile
 ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 mapfile
 e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdb2
 mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdb2 /mnt
 (read rescued files from /mnt)
</pre>
 
Example 3: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hda
freezes up at position 12345678.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile &lt;-- /dev/hda freezes here
 (restart /dev/hda or reboot computer)
 (restart copy at a safe distance from the troubled sector)
 ddrescue -f -i 12350000 /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 (then copy backwards down to the troubled sector)
 ddrescue -f -R /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
</pre>
 
Example 4: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hdb
fails and you have to rescue data to a third drive, /dev/hdc.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile1 &lt;-- /dev/hdb fails here
 ddrescue -f -m mapfile1 /dev/hdb /dev/hdc mapfile2
 ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdc mapfile2
 ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdc mapfile2
</pre>
 
Example 5: While rescuing the whole drive /dev/hda to /dev/hdb, /dev/hda
stops responding and disappears from /dev.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f -n /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile &lt;-- /dev/hda fails here
 (restart /dev/hda or reboot computer as many times as needed)
 ddrescue -f -n -A /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile

<h2 class="chapter">10 Direct disc access</h2>

<p><a name="index-direct-disc-access-13"></a><a name="index-raw-devices-14"></a>
If you notice that the positions and sizes in <var>mapfile</var> are always
multiples of the sector size, maybe your kernel is caching the disc
accesses and grouping them. In this case you may want to use direct disc
access for <var>infile</var>, or read from a raw device, to bypass the kernel
cache and rescue more of your data.

 </p><p>NOTE! Sector size must be correctly set with the '<samp><span class="samp">--sector-size</span></samp>'
option for direct disc access to work.

 </p><p>NOTE: Direct disc access can copy arbitrary domains by reading whole
sectors and then writing only the requested part. This is the only case
where ddrescue will try to read data outside of the rescue domain.

 </p><p>Try the '<samp><span class="samp">--idirect</span></samp>' option first. If direct disc access is not
available in your system, try raw devices. Read your system
documentation to find how to bind a raw device to a regular block
device. Some OSs provide raw access through special device names, like
/dev/rdisk.

 </p><p>Ddrescue aligns its I/O buffer to the sector size so that it can be used
for direct disc access or to read from raw devices. For efficiency
reasons, also aligns it to the memory page size if page size is a
multiple of sector size. On some systems, ddrescue can't determine the
size of a raw device, so an explicit '<samp><span class="samp">--size</span></samp>' or
'<samp><span class="samp">--complete-only</span></samp>' option may be needed.

 </p><p>Using direct disc access, or reading from a raw device, may be slower or
faster than normal cached reading depending on your OS and hardware. In
case it is slower you may want to make a first pass using normal cached
reads and use direct disc access, or a raw device, only to recover the
good sectors inside the failed blocks.

 </p>
Example 1: using direct disc access.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 mapfile
 ddrescue -d -f -r3 /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 mapfile
 e2fsck -v -f /dev/hdc1
 mount -t ext2 -o ro /dev/hdc1 /mnt
</pre>
 
Example 2: using a raw device.

<pre class="example"> raw /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdb1
 ddrescue -f -n /dev/hdb1 /dev/hdc1 mapfile
 ddrescue -C -f -r3 /dev/raw/raw1 /dev/hdc1 mapfile

<h2 class="chapter">11 Fill mode</h2>

<p><a name="index-fill-Mode-15"></a>
When ddrescue is invoked with the '<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode</span></samp>' option it operates
in "fill mode", which is different from the default "rescue mode". That
is, if you use the '<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode</span></samp>' option, ddrescue does not rescue
anything. It only fills with data read from <var>infile</var> the blocks of
<var>outfile</var> whose status character from <var>mapfile</var> coincides with
one of the type characters specified as argument to the
'<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode</span></samp>' option.

 </p><p>If the argument of the '<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode</span></samp>' option contains an '<samp><span class="samp">l</span></samp>',
ddrescue will write location data (position, sector number and status)
into each sector filled. With bad sectors filled in this way, it should
be possible to retry the recovery of important files, as location of the
error is known by looking into the unfinished copy of the file.

 </p><p>In fill mode <var>infile</var> may have any size. If it is too small, the
data will be duplicated as many times as necessary to fill the input
buffer. If it is too big, only the data needed to fill the input buffer
will be read. Then the same data will be written to every cluster or
sector to be filled.

 </p><p>Note that in fill mode <var>infile</var> is always read from position 0. If
you specify a '<samp><span class="samp">--input-position</span></samp>', it refers to the original
<var>infile</var> from which <var>mapfile</var> was built, and is only used to
calculate the offset between input and output positions.

 </p><p>Note also that when filling the <var>infile</var> of the original rescue run
you should not set '<samp><span class="samp">--output-position</span></samp>', whereas when filling the
<var>outfile</var> of the original rescue run you should keep the original
offset between '<samp><span class="samp">--input-position</span></samp>' and '<samp><span class="samp">--output-position</span></samp>'.

 </p><p>The '<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode</span></samp>' option implies the '<samp><span class="samp">--complete-only</span></samp>' option.

 </p><p>In fill mode <var>mapfile</var> is updated to allow resumability when
interrupted or in case of a crash, but as nothing is being rescued
<var>mapfile</var> is not destroyed. The status line is the only part of
<var>mapfile</var> that is modified.

 </p>
The fill mode has a number of uses. See the following examples:

<p class="noindent">Example 1: Mark parts of the rescued copy to allow finding them when
examined in an hex editor. For example, the following command line fills
all blocks marked as '<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' (bad-sector) with copies of the string
'<samp><span class="samp">BAD&#xA0;SECTOR&#xA0;</span></samp>':

</p><pre class="example"> printf "BAD SECTOR " &gt; tmpfile
 ddrescue --fill-mode=- tmpfile outfile mapfile
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Example 2: Wipe only the good sectors, leaving the bad sectors alone. 
This way, the drive will still test bad (i.e., with unreadable sectors). 
This is the fastest way of wiping a failing drive, and is specially
useful when sending the drive back to the manufacturer for warranty
replacement.

</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue --fill-mode=+ --force /dev/zero bad_drive mapfile
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Example 3: Force the drive to remap the bad sectors, making it usable
again. If the drive has only a few bad sectors, and they are not caused
by drive age, you can probably just rewrite those sectors, and the drive
will reallocate them automatically to new "spare" sectors that it keeps
for just this purpose. WARNING! This may not work on your drive.

</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue --fill-mode=- -f --synchronous /dev/zero bad_drive mapfile
</pre>
 
Fill mode can also help you to figure out, independently of the file
system used, what files are partially or entirely in the bad areas of
the disc. Just follow these steps:

 <p>1) Copy the damaged drive with ddrescue until finished. Do not use
sparse writes. This yields a mapfile with only finished ('<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>') and
bad-sector ('<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>') blocks.

 </p><p>2) Fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image file with a
string not present in any file, for example "DEADBEEF". Use
'<samp><span class="samp">--fill-mode=l-</span></samp>' if you want location data.

 </p><p>3) Mount the copied drive (or the image file, via loopback device)
read-only.

 </p><p>4) Grep for the fill string in all the files. Those files containing the
string reside (at least partially) in damaged disc areas. Note that if
all the damaged areas are in unused space, grep will not find the string
in any file, which means that no files are damaged.

 </p><p>5) Take note of the location data of any important files that you want
to retry.

 </p><p>6) Unmount the copied drive or image file.

 </p><p>7) Retry the sectors belonging to the important files until they are
rescued or until it is clear that they can't be rescued.

 </p><p>8) Optionally fill the bad-sector blocks of the copied drive or image
file with zeros to restore the disc image.

</p><p class="noindent">Example 4: Figure out what files are in the bad areas of the disc.

</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue -b2048 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile
 printf "DEADBEEF" &gt; tmpfile
 ddrescue --fill-mode=l- tmpfile cdimage mapfile
 rm tmpfile
 mount -t iso9660 -o loop,ro cdimage /mnt/cdimage
 find /mnt/cdimage -type f -exec grep -l "DEADBEEF" '{}' ';'
 (note that my_thesis.txt has a bad sector at pos 0x12345000)
 umount /mnt/cdimage
 ddrescue -b2048 -i0x12345000 -s2048 -dr9 /dev/cdrom cdimage mapfile

<h2 class="chapter">12 Generate mode</h2>

<p><a name="index-generate-Mode-16"></a>
When ddrescue is invoked with the '<samp><span class="samp">--generate-mode</span></samp>' option it
operates in "generate mode", which is different from the default "rescue
mode". That is, if you use the '<samp><span class="samp">--generate-mode</span></samp>' option, ddrescue
does not rescue anything. It only tries to generate a <var>mapfile</var> for
later use.

 </p><p>So you didn't read the manual and started ddrescue without a
<var>mapfile</var>. Now, two days later, your computer crashed and you can't
know how much data ddrescue managed to save. And even worse, you can't
resume the rescue; you have to restart it from the very beginning.

 </p><p>Or maybe you started copying a drive with <code>dd&#xA0;conv=noerror,sync</code> and are now in the same situation described above. 
In this case, note that you can't use a copy made by dd unless it was
invoked with the '<samp><span class="samp">sync</span></samp>' conversion argument.

 </p><p>Don't despair (yet). Ddrescue can in some cases generate an approximate
<var>mapfile</var>, from <var>infile</var> and the (partial) copy in
<var>outfile</var>, that is almost as good as an exact <var>mapfile</var>. It
makes this by simply assuming that sectors containing all zeros were not
rescued.

 </p><p>However, if the destination of the copy was a drive or a partition, (or
an existing regular file and truncation was not requested), most
probably you will need to restart ddrescue from the very beginning. 
(This time with a <var>mapfile</var>, of course). The reason is that old data
may be present in the drive that have not been overwritten yet, and may
be thus non-tried but non-zero.

 </p><p>For example, if you first tried one of these commands:
</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue infile outfile
 or
 dd if=infile of=outfile conv=noerror,sync
</pre>
 <p>then you can generate an approximate mapfile with this command:
</p><pre class="example"> ddrescue --generate-mode infile outfile mapfile
</pre>
 <p class="noindent">Note that you must keep the original offset between
'<samp><span class="samp">--input-position</span></samp>' and '<samp><span class="samp">--output-position</span></samp>' of the original
rescue run.

<h2 class="chapter">13 Ddrescuelog</h2>

<p><a name="index-ddrescuelog-17"></a>
Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue mapfiles, shows mapfile
contents, converts mapfiles to/from other formats, compares mapfiles,
tests rescue status, and can delete a mapfile if the rescue is done. 
Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one or several parts of the
mapfile if the domain setting options are used.

 </p><p>When performing logic operations (AND, OR, XOR) on mapfiles of different
extension, only the blocks present in both files are processed.

 </p><p>Here are some examples of how to use ddrescuelog, alone or in
combination with other tools.

 </p>
Example 1: Delete the mapfile if the rescue is finished (all data have
been recovered without errors left).

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 ddrescuelog -d mapfile
</pre>
 
Example 2: Rescue two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb and repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. File system block size is 4096.<br>
Note: you do need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand.

<pre class="example"> fdisk /dev/hdb &lt;-- partition /deb/hdb
 ddrescue -f /dev/hda1 /dev/hdb1 mapfile1
 ddrescue -f /dev/hda2 /dev/hdb2 mapfile2
 ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 mapfile1 &gt; badblocks1
 ddrescuelog -l- -b4096 mapfile2 &gt; badblocks2
 e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks1 /dev/hdb1
 e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks2 /dev/hdb2
</pre>
 
Example 3: Rescue a whole disc with two ext2 partitions in /dev/hda to
/dev/hdb and repair the file systems using badblock lists generated with
ddrescuelog. Disc sector size is 512, file system block size is 4096. 
Arguments to options '<samp></samp>' and '<samp></samp>' are the starting positions
and sizes of the partitions being rescued.<br>
Note: you do not need to partition /dev/hdb beforehand, but if the
partition table on /dev/hda is damaged, you'll need to recreate it
somehow on /dev/hdb.

<pre class="example"> ddrescue -f /dev/hda /dev/hdb mapfile
 fdisk /dev/hdb &lt;-- get partition sizes
 ddrescuelog -l- -b512 -i63s -o0 -s767457s -b4096 mapfile &gt; badblocks1
 ddrescuelog -l- -b512 -i767520s -o0 -s96520s -b4096 mapfile &gt; badblocks2
 e2fsck -v -f -L badblocks1 /dev/hdb1

The format for running ddrescuelog is:

</p><pre class="example"> ddrescuelog [<var>options</var>] <var>mapfile</var>

 </p><p>Ddrescuelog supports the following options:

 </p><dl>
<dt><code>-h</code><dt><code>--help</code></dt></dt><dd>Print an informative help message describing the options and exit.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-V</code><dt><code>--version</code></dt></dt><dd>Print the version number of ddrescuelog on the standard output and exit.

characters as defined in the chapter Mapfile structure (see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/manual/ddrescue_manual.html#Mapfile-structure">Mapfile structure</a>). Blocks whose status is not in <var>old_types</var> are left
unchanged. If <var>new_types</var> is shorter than <var>old_types</var> the last
type of <var>new_types</var> is repeated as many times as necessary.

 <br></dd><dt><code>-b </code><var>bytes</var><dt><code>--block-size=</code><var>bytes</var></dt></dt><dd>Block size used by ddrescuelog. Depending on the requested operation it

There are probably bugs in ddrescue. There are certainly errors and
omissions in this manual. If you report them, they will get fixed. If
you don't, no one will ever know about them and they will remain unfixed
for all eternity, if not longer.

 </p><p>If you find a bug in GNU ddrescue, please send electronic mail to
<a href="mailto:bug-ddrescue@gnu.org">bug-ddrescue@gnu.org</a>. Include the version number, which you can
find by running <code>ddrescue&#xA0;--version</code>.
