<p>This is a simple experiment to authenticate web sessions with SSH. Doing so gives you a fully decentralized, passwordless authentication for free!</p>

<h2><a id="user-content-how-it-works" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/altitude/login-with-ssh#how-it-works"></a>How it works</h2>

<p>A custom SSH server listens for connections. Instead of providing a shell or any other service, it only validates the public key you offer. Then, a callback is made to a web application with a payload containing the validated public key along with the login token used.</p>

<p>In practise, you would have first hit a "login with SSH button" on the web app. It would have generated a session that resolves into a valid one with a callback handing the proper key / token combination.</p>

<p>The code here is not intendend to be used beyond the context of this experiment (read: don't use this in production!). A proper implementation would probably have to use a better SSH library like <a href="https://www.libssh.org/">libssh</a>.<br>
Anyway, have fun!</p>
