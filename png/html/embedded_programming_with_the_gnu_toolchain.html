<p>The GNU toolchain is increasingly being used for deeply embedded
software development. This type of software development is also
called standalone C programming and bare metal C programming.
Standalone C programming brings along with it new problems, and
dealing with them requires a deeper understanding of the GNU
toolchain. The GNU toolchain&#x2019;s manuals provide excellent
information on the toolchain, but from the perspective of the
toolchain, rather than the perspective of the problem. Well, that
is how manuals are supposed to be written anyway. The result is
that the answers to common problems are scattered all over, and new
users of the GNU toolchain are left baffled.</p>
<p>This tutorial attempts to bridge the gap by explaining the tools
from the perspective of the problem. Hopefully, this should enable
more people to use the GNU toolchain for their embedded
projects.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, an ARM based embedded system
is emulated using Qemu. With this you can learn the GNU toolchain
from the comforts of your desktop, without having to invest on
hardware. This tutorial itself does not teach the ARM instruction
set. It is supposed to be used with other books and on-line
tutorials like:</p>

<p>But for the convenience of the reader, frequently used ARM
instructions are listed in the appendix.</p>
