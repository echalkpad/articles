<p>A programmer is a person who can create and modify computer programs. No matter what type of programmer one may be, each and every contributes something to the society, no matter how trivial. Yet, there are those few who have contributed beyond what a single programmer usually does in an entire lifetime.&#xA0;These programmers are pioneers in their respective areas and have each contributed something that has completely changed the way human&#x2019;s access information and media. So without further ado, here we present the 12 greatest programmers of all time:</p>

<h3><strong>12. Ada Lovelace</strong></h3>

<p>Augusta Ada King, more commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and the world&#x2019;s first computer programmer and was chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage&#x2019;s early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. The notes she created for the Analytical Engine include what is recognized as the very first algorithm created solely for the intent of being processed by a machine or in other words, the world&#x2019;s first computer program.</p>
<p>Ada was a gifted girl from the beginning with an uncommon mindset who predicted that one day computers would transcend from simply being used for crunching numbers &#x2014; totally against the popular opinion of that time. Ada&#x2019;s main inspiration came from her father and without her, who knows how long it would take for another person to design a computer program.</p>

<h3><strong>11. Niklaus Wirth</strong></h3>
<p><img class="alignnone" title="Niklaus Wirth Pascal" src="http://www.arkhitech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Niklaus-Wirth.jpg" alt="Niklaus Wirth" width="610"></p>
<p>Niklaus Emil Wirth is a Swiss computer scientist who is regarded as a pioneer of computer programming among other fields in software engineering. He is best known for designing several programming languages, including the highly popular Pascal, Euler, Algol W, Modula, Modula-2, Oberon, Oberon-2, and Oberon-07. He also designed the simple programming language PL/0 to illustrate compiler design which formed the basis for many university compiler design classes.</p>
<p>Niklaus had previously worked on part of the design and implementation team for the Lilith and Oberon operating systems as well as the Lola digital hardware design and simulation system. Wirth&#x2019;s pioneering work and development of innovative computer languages helped him win the prestigious Turing Award in 1984.</p>

<h3><strong>10. Bill Gates</strong></h3>

<p>Arguably one of the most popular computer programmers of all time, Bill Gates is an American business magnate, computer programmer, PC pioneer, investor, and philanthropist. He is the co-founder, ex-executive officer and current chairman of Microsoft, which is the world&#x2019;s largest personal-computer software company. He is the best-known entrepreneurs of the personal computer revolution and helped develop Windows, which is the most used operating system in the world.</p>
<p>For the first 5 years at Microsoft, aside from handling the business side of the company, Gates also personally oversaw every single code that the company sent out, often fixing ones he deemed incorrect or buggy. Aside from his programming skills, he is widely praised for his generosity and keen investment planning, but is highly criticized due to his anti-competitive business tactics.</p>

<h3><strong>9. James Gosling</strong></h3>

<p>James Arthur Gosling is a Canadian computer scientist and an officer of the order of Canada. He has coded quite a number of programs but is widely known for his creation of the highly successful and commonly used Java programming language in 1994 as well as its original virtual machine and compiler.&#xA0;He credits his creation towards his graduate student days where he created a p-code virtual machine for the lab&#x2019;s DEC VAX computer, so that his professor could run UCSD Pascal programs and then realized that the architecture-neutral execution for widely distributed programs could be achieved by a similar technique.</p>
<p>James has also made major contributions to several other software systems, such as NeWS and Gosling Emacs. Due to his extra-ordinary achievements&#xA0;Gosling was elected to Foreign Associate member of the United States National Academy of Engineering.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Guido van Rossum</strong></h3>

<p>Guido van Rossum is a Dutch computer programmer who is the author of the popular Python programming language that is wildly used today. His creation of Python lead him to being declared a &#x201C;Benevolent Dictator For Life&#x201D; the In the Python community which means that he continues to oversee the Python development process, making decisions where necessary, forever.</p>
<p>Rossum had developed Python while working at Google, where he also created Mondrian (a code review system internally used by the Google) and Rietveld. After working for Google for 7 years, he is now working at Dropbox. Rossum has been recognized as a distinguished engineer by the Association for Computing Machinery and also received the NLUUG Award in May 2003.</p>

<h3><strong>7. Ken Thompson</strong></h3>

<p>Kenneth Lane Thompson, or simply &#x201C;Ken&#x201D; as he is called by the hacker community, is an American pioneer of computer science. Thompson had designed and implemented the original Unix operating system and also invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the famous C programming language), and was one of the early developers of the Plan 9 operating systems.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Thompson has also co-invented the Go programming language while working at Google. Ken&#x2019;s other contributions included his work on regular expressions, early computer text editors QED and ed, the definition of the UTF-8 encoding, and even his work on computer chess that included creation of endgame tablebases and the chess machine Belle.</p>

<h3><strong>6. Donald Knuth</strong></h3>
