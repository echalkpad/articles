 </figure><p class="story-body__introduction">Linus Torvalds may have created one of the world's most collaborative tools with his open-source operating system Linux - but he actually prefers to work alone.</p><p>The software creator gave a rare interview at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver.</p><p>He revealed that he did not originally intend to make Linux open-source.</p><p>He also admitted that sharing his work was not an easy decision.</p><p>"I did not start Linux as a collaborative project, I started it for myself. I needed the end result but I also enjoyed programming," he said.</p><p>"I made it publicly available but I had no intention to use the open-source methodology, I just wanted to have comments on the work."</p><p>Mr Torvalds was surprisingly open as he was interviewed on the TED stage, revealing that he works at home in an office devoid of noise or distraction.</p><p>"It is the most boring office you'll ever see," he said.</p> <p>"I often work in my bathrobe, and I have to have complete silence."</p><p>It may seem surprising for someone credited with kick-starting the open-source movement and running a software empire, but for Mr Torvalds it comes down to personality.</p><p>"I am not a people person," he revealed.</p><p>Asked what he was like as a child, he said that he had always been a "nerd".</p><p>"My sister had to brief me about who family members were. I was more interested in my Rubik's Cube than my younger brother."</p><p>He has, he explained, come to learn that having different people involved in a project is important.</p><p>"We need the 'people people' who are warm and friendly. I just care about the technology and there are things that I can't do.</p><p>"I am not a visionary. I'm an engineer. I'm happy with the people who are wandering around looking at the stars but I am looking at the ground and I want to fix the pothole before I fall in."</p><p>Just don't ask him to design a user interface (UI).</p><p>"I can't do it to save my life. If I was stranded on a desert island and the only way to get off was to create a pretty UI I would die there," he joked.</p>
