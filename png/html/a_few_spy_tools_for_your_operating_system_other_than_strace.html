<div><div class="entry-content"><p>There are <em>so many</em> awesome tools you can use to find out what&#x2019;s going on with
your computer. Here are some that exist on Linux. They might exist on your OS
too!</p>
<h3 id="netstat">netstat</h3>
<p>netstat tells you what ports are open on your computer. This is crazy useful if
you want to know if the service that is <em>supposed</em> to be listening on port 8080
is <em>actually</em> listening on port 8080. </p>

<p>If you look at the Program Name column on the right, you&#x2019;ll see that
apparently I have cupsd (printing), postgres, and redis servers running
on my machine, as well as some other stuff that I redacted. I actually
have no idea why I had redis installed so uh yeah I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>I use netstat pretty often when I&#x2019;m trying to debug &#x201C;omg why is this
thing not running IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE RUNNING&#x201D;. netstat tells me the
truth about whether it is running.</p>
 
<h3 id="dstat">dstat</h3>
<p>Want to know how much data is actually being written to your physical hard
drive right this second? YEAH YOU DO. dstat knows that. It prints a row every
second with stats for that second. I love dstat because it&#x2019;s so simple.</p>

<h3 id="lsof">lsof</h3>
<p>lsof tells you which files every process has open right now! That&#x2019;s all!
It is awesome the same way dstat and netstat are awesome &#x2013; you want to
know what files are open right now, it tells you what files are open
right now, you&#x2019;re done &lt;3.</p>
<p>It can also tell you what position in the file the process is at, so you
can find out what kind of progress it&#x2019;s making reading the file.</p>
<h3 id="ngrep--tcpdump">ngrep / tcpdump</h3>
<p>Okay now we&#x2019;re moving from &#x201C;super simple tool that does one thing&#x201D; to
&#x201C;tcpdump that has a billion options and also this whole BPF berkeley
packet filter business and what is this filter language even&#x201D;. So I&#x2019;m
not going to explain how to use tcpdump because I don&#x2019;t even really
know.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say you want to</p>
<ul>
<li>reverse engineer a protocol</li>
<li>find out if there&#x2019;s <em>really</em> terrible latency or if everything is slow for some other reason</li>
<li>debug why your POST request is formatted wrong in a world before google chrome dev tools</li>
</ul>
<p>To do all of this, you need to spy on network activity! ngrep and tcpdump
capture packets, let you filter them, and show you what you&#x2019;re looking for. I&#x2019;m
not going to explain how to use them here but <a href="http://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/general/ngreptut.txt">this ngrep tutorial</a> looks
pretty useful. If you&#x2019;re looking at output from tcpdump you should probably
dump it to a pcap file and use Wireshark to look at it instead. Wireshark is
the best and way easier to understand because it&#x2019;s a GUI and it makes
everything pretty for you.</p>
<p>as always with these systems tools, ngrep / tcpdump will tell you The Truth&#x2122;
about what&#x2019;s going on on your network.</p>
<p>If you want to know how people use tcpdump, you should read <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/585234410980712448">the replies to this tweet &#x201C;do you use tcpdump in your day-to-day life? what do you use it for?&#x201D;</a> because the people
who follow me on twitter are the best. Really go read them! There is so much
interesting stuff there.</p>
<h3 id="opensnoop--ftrace">opensnoop &amp; ftrace</h3>
<p>Do you want to know every file your system is opening right now? There&#x2019;s a
script in Brendan Gregg&#x2019;s
<a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools">perf-tools</a> collection that does
that!</p>
<p>I&#x2019;m mostly including this as an example to show that a lot of stuff is
<em>possible</em> to know &#x2013; the scripts in that repo don&#x2019;t work with every Linux kernel
version (I needed to <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/perf-tools/pull/24">modify it</a>
to get it to work with Linux 3.13). But they use a tracing framework in
the Linux kernel called &#x2018;ftrace&#x2019; that can tell you all <em>kinds</em> of stuff.</p>
<p>ftrace seems like quite a bit of work to learn how to use, but also really
powerful. Basically you access it by doing various things to files in
<code>/sys/kernel/debug/tracing</code>, or by using a wrapper command called
<code>trace-cmd</code>. It&#x2019;s all built into Linux!</p>
<h3 id="atop">atop</h3>
<p>atop is like top, but it shows you more stuff and you need to run it as
root. So it&#x2019;ll show me the CPU &amp; memory usage for each process, but also
how much disk &amp; network I/O it&#x2019;s doing. It&#x2019;s neat and a little
terrifying to look at at first (SO MANY NUMBERS).</p>
<h3 id="wow">wow</h3>
<p>That&#x2019;s all for now! If you have other tools you frequently reach for
when trying to figure out what&#x2019;s going on on your system, I&#x2019;d be
interested to know what they are. <a href="https://twitter.com/b0rk">@b0rk</a> on
Twitter, as always :)</p>
<p>an aside &#x2013; I&#x2019;ve been thinking about man pages recently, and how you can
read the man page for tcpdump and understand individually all the words,
but it&#x2019;s not a substitute for someone telling you an Awesome Story about
how they used tcpdump to debug an intermittent certificate problem or a
DNS problem and then they Saved the Day.</p>
