 <p id="p-1">Writing about traumatic, stressful or emotional events has been found to result in improvements in both physical and psychological health, in non-clinical and clinical populations. In the expressive writing paradigm, participants are asked to write about such events for 15&#x2013;20 minutes on 3&#x2013;5 occasions. Those who do so generally have significantly better physical and psychological outcomes compared with those who write about neutral topics. Here we present an overview of the expressive writing paradigm, outline populations for which it has been found to be beneficial and discuss possible mechanisms underlying the observed health benefits. In addition, we suggest how expressive writing can be used as a therapeutic tool for survivors of trauma and in psychiatric settings.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Over the past 20 years, a growing body of literature has demonstrated the beneficial effects that writing about traumatic or stressful events has on physical and emotional health. In the first study on expressive writing (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-42">Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986</a>), college students wrote for 15 minutes on 4 consecutive days about &#x2018;the most traumatic or upsetting experiences&#x2019; of their entire lives, while controls wrote about superficial topics (such as their room or their shoes). Participants who wrote about their deepest thoughts and feelings reported significant benefits in both objectively assessed and self-reported physical health 4 months later, with less frequent visits to the health centre and a trend towards fewer days out of role owing to illness. The authors concluded that:</p><p id="p-3">

 </p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Expressive writing studies</h2><p id="p-5">The basic writing paradigm (<a id="xref-ref-37-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-37">Pennebaker, 1994</a>, <a id="xref-ref-38-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-38">1997<em>a</em></a>, <a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-39">1997<em>b</em></a>; <a id="xref-ref-62-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-62">Smyth &amp; Pennebaker, 1999</a>) used in most of the subsequent expressive writing studies involves participants writing about traumatic or emotional experiences (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>) for 3&#x2013;5 sessions, often over consecutive days, for 15&#x2013;20 minutes per session. Most studies have been conducted in the laboratory, although more recently writing has been done at home or in a clinical setting. Participants often reveal a considerable range and depth of emotional trauma in their writing. Although many report being upset by the writing experience, they also find it valuable and meaningful (<a id="xref-ref-39-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-39">Pennebaker, 1997<em>b</em></a>). Control participants are asked to write as objectively and factually as possible about neutral topics such as a particular room or their plans for the day, without revealing their emotions or opinions. No feedback is given on the writing.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Typical writing instructions</strong></h3>
 <p id="p-7">For the next 4 days, I would like you to write your very deepest thoughts and feelings about the most traumatic experience of your entire life or an extremely important emotional issue that has affected you and your life. In your writing, I&#x2019;d like you to really let go and explore your deepest emotions and thoughts. You might tie your topic to your relationships with others, including parents, lovers, friends or relatives; to your past, your present or your future; or to who you have been, who you would like to be or who you are now. You may write about the same general issues or experiences on all days of writing or about different topics each day. All of your writing will be completely confidential.</p>
 <p id="p-8">Don&#x2019;t worry about spelling, grammar or sentence structure. The only rule is that once you begin writing, you continue until the time is up.</p>

However, at longer-term follow-up, many studies have continued to find evidence of health benefits in terms of objectively assessed outcomes, self-reported physical health outcomes and self-reported emotional health outcomes (Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-2"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 2</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Longer-term benefits of expressive writing</strong></h3>

Confronting a trauma through talking or writing about it and acknowledging the associated emotions is thought to reduce the physiological work of inhibition, gradually lowering the overall stress on the body. Such confrontation involves translating the event into words, enabling cognitive integration and understanding of it, which further contribute to the reduction in physiological activity associated with inhibition and ruminations (<a id="xref-ref-36-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-36">Pennebaker, 1985</a>).</p><p id="p-65">This theory has intuitive appeal but mixed empirical support. Studies have shown that expressive writing results in significant improvements in various biochemical markers of physical and immune functioning (<a id="xref-ref-45-5" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-45">Pennebaker <em>et al</em>, 1988</a>; <a id="xref-ref-11-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-11">Esterling <em>et al</em>, 1994</a>; <a id="xref-ref-47-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-47">Petrie <em>et al</em>, 1995</a>; <a id="xref-ref-4-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-4">Booth <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>). This suggests that written disclosure may reduce the physiological stress on the body caused by inhibition, although it does not necessarily mean that disinhibition is the causal mechanism underlying these biological effects. On the other hand, participants writing about previously undisclosed traumas showed no differences in health outcomes from those writing about previously disclosed traumas (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-18">Greenberg &amp; Stone, 1992</a>) and participants writing about imaginary traumas that they had not actually experienced, and therefore could not have inhibited, also demonstrated significant improvements in physical health (<a id="xref-ref-19-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-19">Greenberg <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>). Therefore, although inhibition may play a part, the observed benefits of writing are not entirely due to reductions in inhibition.</p></div><div id="sec-15" class="subsection"><h3>Development of a coherent narrative</h3><p id="p-66">A computerised text analysis system, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC; <a id="xref-ref-46-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-46">Pennebaker <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>), was specifically designed to determine whether certain linguistic markers might be associated with improvements in health. The LIWC program analyses the writing tasks by calculating the percentage of words in the text matching each of 82 predefined language categories. The most consistent finding has been that, over the course of writing, participants whose health improved used more positive-emotion words, a moderate number of negative-emotion words and an increased number of &#x2018;cognitive mechanism&#x2019; words (the latter include insight words such as <em>understand</em>, <em>realise</em> and causal words such as <em>because</em>, <em>reason</em>) (<a id="xref-ref-39-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-39">Pennebaker, 1997<em>b</em></a>).</p><p id="p-67">The subsequent suggestion that the beneficial effect of expressive writing is the development of a coherent narrative over time, reflecting increasing cognitive processing of the experience, is consistent with the literature on traumatic memory and trauma treatment (e.g. <a id="xref-ref-72-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-72">van der Kolk <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>).

However, given its simplicity, expressive writing appears to have great potential as a therapeutic tool in diverse clinical settings or as a means of self-help, either alone or as an adjunct to traditional therapies (see also <a id="xref-ref-61-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-61">Smyth &amp; Helm, 2003</a>; <a id="xref-ref-41-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-41">Pennebaker, 2004</a>). For example, promising results have been found using e-mail-based writing assignments (<a id="xref-ref-56-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-56">Sheese <em>et al</em>, 2004</a>), an internet-based writing intervention for post-traumatic stress (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-27">Lange <em>et al</em>, 2000</a>) and writing tasks for couples recovering from an extramarital affair (<a id="xref-ref-66-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-66">Snyder <em>et al</em>, 2004</a>).</p><p id="p-73">In extending the paradigm to clinical settings, following as much of the traditional protocol as possible will make it more likely that health benefits will be achieved (see also <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-2">Batten, 2002</a>). Although there is no direct evidence, it has been suggested that the more structured approach of the expressive writing paradigm is more beneficial than simple diary-keeping (<a id="xref-ref-62-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-62">Smyth &amp; Pennebaker, 1999</a>). In addition, it seems that incorporating both the cognitive and the emotional components of the experience (i.e. thoughts and feelings) is helpful (<a id="xref-ref-42-6" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-42">Pennebaker &amp; Beall, 1986</a>; <a id="xref-ref-62-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-62">Smyth &amp; Pennebaker, 1999</a>).

 </div><p id="p-87">As the application of expressive writing outside of research settings is relatively recent, it is recommended that clinicians collect some data to assess its effectiveness in their particular setting, including appropriate pre- and post-writing measures of physical health, psychological health or general functioning (see Box 6<a id="xref-boxed-text-6-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#boxed-text-6"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-6"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 6</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Notes on expressive writing</strong></h3>
 <p id="p-89">As a clinical psychiatrist working in a public teaching hospital, I (K.W.) have found expressive writing to be a useful addition to my repertoire of short-term psychological interventions for people who harm themselves, in the medical wards and for out-patients with stress-related symptoms, anxiety and depression. I use it together with daily mood charts, problem-solving, goal-setting, relaxation, mindfulness, exercise prescription and other interventions that form part of the Black Dog Institute&#x2019;s general practitioner education programme (for related screening measures and information sheets follow the prompt for Clinician aids on the Institute&#x2019;s website at <a href="http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au">http://www.blackdoginstitute.org.au</a>).</p>
 <p id="p-90">I keep a series of empty journals of different colours (to offer a choice) and ask patients to write on four occasions, following the instructions in Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-4" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>. They are told to write for themselves and it is up to them whether they want to share the writing with anyone else. Later, I give some feedback on the changes in writing (after linguistic analysis), if requested.</p>
 <p id="p-91">Writing has helped people to resolve longstanding issues about relationships at home and work, and to put into words feelings that have been too sensitive to describe face to face. Some patients have shown their writing to significant others and found this helpful.</p>
 <p id="p-92">Research suggests that writing may be more beneficial for men and, in my experience, men have certainly found it an acceptable intervention.</p>
 <p id="p-93">The writing is intended for patients to use as a short-term intervention to start a process of dialogue with themselves or to &#x2018;unblock&#x2019; a difficult issue. It is not intended to replace face-to-face interaction and is best done with a follow-up appointment for debriefing.</p>
 <p id="p-94">As the whole point is to bring up issues that are emotionally charged, it is important to work out the best timing for the writing and to have a contingency plan if the patient becomes distressed.</p>
 <p id="p-95">For some people the experience has been extremely helpful and has quickly resolved issues that have been mulled over &#x2013; sometimes for years &#x2013; with no resolution.</p>
 <p id="p-96">I encourage people to continue to use their journals in whatever way they think best, and most do so.</p>
 </div></div><div class="section" id="sec-20"><h2>Cautions and limitations</h2><p id="p-97">Expressive writing is generally associated with an immediate increase in negative affect, but this short-term distress does not appear to be detrimental or to pose a longer-term risk to participants (<a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/338#ref-22">Hockemeyer <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). Given the large number of studies conducted to date, with only a few finding any worsening of symptoms for those writing about traumatic experiences, the expressive writing paradigm appears to be reasonably safe for participants, even if no specific benefits are obtained. However, it is recommended that patients be told that they can stop writing at any time, should they wish, and appropriate contact numbers should be made available in case of distress. Patients should be encouraged to write for a maximum of 20 min at each session, so that the task does not seem too overwhelming, although they may choose to continue writing once the time is up if they wish and if this is feasible.</p><p id="p-98">Regardless of the demonstrated benefits of expressive writing, it should not replace appropriate medical or psychological treatment in clinical populations; it should be used as an adjunct to standard treatment while further research is being conducted.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-21"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-6"><li id="list-item-40">

 <p id="p-1">Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) is a relatively recent therapeutic approach to the treatment of traumatic memories in the wake of psychological trauma such as those found in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is based on the theory that bilateral stimulation, mostly in the form of eye movements, allows the processing of traumatic memories. While the patient focuses on specific images, negative sensations and associated cognitions, bilateral stimulation is applied to desensitise the individual to these memories and more positive sensations and cognitions are introduced. Although there is still uncertainty about the theoretical concepts underlying EMDR and the role of bilateral stimulation, it is an effective and proven treatment for PTSD and traumatic memories. It should form part of treatment approaches offered to individuals with PTSD.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) literally owes its beginnings to a walk in the park. In 1987 an American psychologist named Francine Shapiro noticed while walking through a park that some disturbing thoughts that had been troubling her had &#x2018;suddenly disappeared&#x2019;. She also noted that when she recalled these thoughts, they were not as disturbing or as valid as they had been previously. She postulated that upsetting thoughts in general have a repetitive quality that changes only if the individual intentionally does something to cause change. However, her disturbing thoughts had changed without conscious effort. After considering this, she realised that during her walk her eyes had moved from side to side and she speculated that this might have been a key factor in her ability to process the disturbing memories. After experiments involving over 70 people, she published the first paper on EMDR 2 years later (<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-20">Shapiro, 1989</a>). Since that time EMDR has attracted supporters and detractors in equal numbers as it has rapidly spread through the international therapeutic community, especially in the field of trauma.</p><p id="p-3">In this article we concentrate on EMDR therapy for trauma, only briefly discussing its use in other anxiety and adjustment conditions. We review the process of EMDR and evaluate biological mechanisms that may underly its therapeutic effect. We also summarise the current clinical and evidence-based case for its use in practice, and give a brief overview of areas of controversy.</p><div class="section" id="sec-11"><h2>Proposed mechanisms of action</h2><div id="sec-13" class="subsection"><h3>Survival and conditioning</h3><p id="p-34"><a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-13">MacCulloch &amp; Feldman (1996)</a> proposed a model for the effects of EMDR based on Pavlovian and Darwinian theory.</p><p id="p-35">The Darwinian theory of natural selection holds that an organism will survive only if it can respond to threats and opportunities presented by its environment. Therefore, it would need to evolve to respond appropriately to threats, and seek to confront or escape them. Organisms unable to adapt to threats will be deselected by the evolutionary process and become extinct.</p><p id="p-36">Pavlovian theory holds that a stimulus can lead to a conditioned response, especially if the pairing has a notably favourable or detrimental outcome. An example would be the way a predator will learn to avoid a porcupine after attacking it is paired with experiencing its painful and dangerous defence.</p><p id="p-37">Applying this Pavlovian model to humans, a person perceives an external stimulus, which gives rise to an orienting response in which lateral, searching eye movements are important. This allows it to locate the source of the stimulus, which in turn triggers an investigatory reflex. If danger is identified, either from previous Pavlovian learning or an instinctive response programmed by evolution, it evokes a negative visceral response that is associated with fear. This results in avoidance behaviour, which would cause the person to fight, flee or freeze. Conversely, if no danger is identified, the stimulus will evoke the positive visceral element of the investigatory reflex, which is associated with reassurance and approach behaviour. This would cause the person to interact with and explore the stimulus.</p><p id="p-38">MacCulloch &amp; Feldman suggest that EMDR uses this positive visceral element of the investigatory reflex to enable exploration and interaction with feared stimuli and their eventual integration.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-19"><h2>Clinical efficacy</h2><p id="p-53">There have been many studies of the efficacy of EMDR therapy for a wide range of clinical problems. Many of these are of dubious quality and add further to the controversy. For the purposes of this article we focus on the highest-level evidence and, as mentioned earlier, restrict ourselves to the field of trauma (which is in fact where the most published evidence exists for the use of EMDR). There are currently three published meta-analyses on efficacy.</p><p id="p-54">In an analysis of the results of 61 treatment-outcome trials for PTSD, <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-26">Van Etten &amp; Taylor (1998)</a> compared the effect sizes of various medications and psychological therapies, including EMDR and behavioural therapy. The psychological therapies had significantly lower drop-out rates than the pharmacotherapies (14% <em>v</em>. 32%). Overall, the most effective psychological therapies (EMDR and behavioural therapy, with little to choose between them) and pharmacological treatments (SSRIs and carbamazepine) were generally equally effective. The psychological therapies were more effective in terms of symptom reduction, but the SSRIs held advantages in treating depression.</p><p id="p-55"><a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-5">Davidson &amp; Parker (2001)</a> conducted a much more selective meta-analysis of 34 studies of EMDR therapy. They included only published work (not conference papers) that permitted a clear evaluation of the immediate post-treatment effects of EMDR. They excluded reports on follow-up outcomes. This gave a relatively small number of trials and excluded a large body of evidence, but ensured the high quality of those included. They concluded that EMDR is as effective as other exposure techniques, although not superior. As discussed below, they also failed to demonstrate the need for eye movements.</p><p id="p-56">In an attempt to reduce the &#x2018;noise&#x2019; created by studies of dubious quality, <a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-14">Maxfield &amp; Hyer (2002)</a> included just 12 trials in their meta-analysis relating treatment efficacy and trial methodology. Importantly, they found that the greater the methodological rigour of the study, the greater the effect size in favour of EMDR for PTSD. All 12 trials were controlled treatment-outcome studies that measured EMDR against waiting-list controls or standard treatments. None of these used robust trauma-focused cognitive&#x2013;behavioural therapy (CBT), which is considered the gold standard of treatment (National Institute of Clinical Excellence, 2005). The findings should therefore be viewed cautiously, as the increased effect size may be due both to the comparison of EMDR with treatments that do not have great benefits for PTSD and to the small number of trials studied, loading the outcome in favour of EMDR.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-20"><h2>The use of EMDR with other clinical conditions</h2><p id="p-57">Since the introduction of EMDR as an effective clinical tool for trauma, it was inevitable that it would be tried for other clinical conditions. Positive therapeutic results have been reported for a wide variety of problems, including phobias and panic disorders (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-6">De Jongh &amp; Ten Broeke, 1998</a>), morbid jealousy (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-2">Blore, 1997</a>) and chronic pain (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-8">Grant &amp; Threlfo, 2002</a>). However, many of these studies are single case reports. A number of studies and reports attest to the efficacy of EMDR with children as well (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-11">Lovett, 1996</a>; <a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-24">Tinker &amp; Wilson, 1999</a>).</p><div id="sec-21" class="subsection"><h3>Chronic pain</h3><p id="p-58">The most promising alternative use has been for the treatment of chronic pain (<a id="xref-ref-8-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-8">Grant &amp; Threlfo, 2002</a>). It is generally accepted that pain, particularly chronic pain, involves psychological factors, either as a reaction to or a predisposing factor for it. When associated with physical injury, trauma can also maintain or exacerbate pain. In a study of Vietnam war veterans who experienced chronic pain, participants who also had PSTD rated their pain and level of disability higher than those who did not have the disorder (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-1">Beckham <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>).</p><p id="p-59">It has also been found that pain can cause trauma. Women with PTSD following obstetric or gynaecological procedures attributed their trauma in part to excessive pain (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-15">Menage, 1993</a>). <a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-22">Schreiber &amp; Galai-Gat (1993)</a> reported the case of an individual who lost an eye in an accident and developed PTSD. The core trauma was found to be uncontrolled pain while waiting 7 hours for surgery.</p><p id="p-60">In the psychological treatment of chronic pain, EMDR seems to improve coping, give relatively permanent reduction of pain and alter pain-related attitudes and beliefs (<a id="xref-ref-8-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-8">Grant &amp; Threlfo, 2002</a>). However, physiological damage associated with long-term injury processes means that pain relief in these cases may be limited. Nevertheless, the use of EMDR for pain problems is an interesting and clinically useful development (<a id="xref-ref-8-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-8">Grant &amp; Threlfo, 2002</a>).</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-22"><h2>Discussion</h2><p id="p-61">Both proponents and opponents of EMDR feel very strongly about their views, and this passion has only grown in intensity as the procedure has gained prominence as an effective treatment. Much of the early criticism was directed at Francine Shapiro herself. Her initial claims heralding EMDR as a panacea for traumatic memories served only as fuel for sceptics. Arguably, the commercialisation of EMDR training worldwide, even when the evidence-base was not robust, did little to appease detractors. Consequently, EMDR&#x2019;s increasing acceptance by the therapeutic community has been accompanied by equally vociferous condemnation and scepticism. Sadly, at times, true scientific debate seems to have fallen victim to extremely held opinions.</p><div id="sec-25" class="subsection"><h3>Imaginal exposure in another guise?</h3><p id="p-64">It has been suggested on numerous occasions that EMDR without eye movements amounts to no more than imaginal exposure, which therefore explains its efficacy.</p><p id="p-65">The issue of whether EMDR is simply a variant of imaginal exposure has been hotly debated in the literature. As mentioned above, many have argued that it is similar to systematic desensitisation or prolonged exposure. However, the use of EMDR with children provides a different perspective on this issue. <a id="xref-ref-24-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-24">Tinker &amp; Wilson (1999</a>: pp. 25&#x2013;26) present the following explanation of the difference between EMDR and imaginal exposure:</p><p id="p-66">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">&#x2018;If five or ten minutes of EMDR lead to cessation of symptoms in a child, due to the &#x201C;exposure&#x201D; of the child to memories of a traumatic event, and this is considered exposure therapy, then all therapy would have to be considered exposure therapy. Thus, with children, it becomes very difficult to see EMDR as a form of exposure, unless the term &#x201C;exposure&#x201D; is broadened to become all encompassing&#x2019;.</q>
 </p><p id="p-68">Therefore, as EMDR uses intermittent stimulation and the results are not dose-related, it is difficult to attribute its effects to exposure alone (<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-25">Wilson <em>et al</em>, 1995</a>).</p></div><div id="sec-26" class="subsection"><h3>Accelerated therapeutic effect?</h3><p id="p-69">Proponents of EMDR have claimed that the onset of therapeutic benefit is more rapid than with other psychological treatments, thus requiring fewer sessions. Although this assertion is supported by some randomised trials &#x2013; for example <a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-18">Rothbaum (1997)</a> and <a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-19">Scheck <em>et al</em>(1998)</a> report therapeutic change within three and two sessions respectively &#x2013; it is not upheld by the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH). In evidence-based clinical guidelines on the management of PTSD commissioned by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, the NCCMH recommends that patients should be offered up to 12 sessions, regardless of the mode of therapy used (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-16">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health, 2005</a>).</p><p id="p-70">In these guidelines it is concluded that EMDR is an effective treatment for PTSD, but that the evidence base is not as strong as that for trauma-focused CBT. However, direct comparisons of trauma-focused CBT, exposure CBT and EMDR showed that none had significant advantages over the others with respect to treatment outcome and the speed of therapeutic changes. All three interventions are currently considered superior to stress management, group CBT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, non-directive therapies and hypnotherapy. The guidelines recommend that all people with PTSD should be offered a trauma-focused psychological treatment that includes EMDR or CBT. The NCCMH recommendations for the psychological treatment of PTSD are summarised in Box 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-3"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 4</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Summary of NCCMH guidelines for psychological therapy in PTSD</strong></h3>

 </div></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-27"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-82">In its current form, EMDR is an established treatment for PTSD and its use is supported by sound empirical evidence to the level of meta-analyses. It appears to be as effective as the gold standard treatment of trauma-focused CBT. There may be considerable scope for EMDR to be part of a CBT repertoire, as many of the components of EMDR sit comfortably within a CBT framework. It is an active, directive and collaborative technique, which is imminently accessible to clinicians trained in CBT.</p><p id="p-83"><a id="xref-ref-16-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/347#ref-16">National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (2005)</a></p><p id="p-84">Published evidence justifies the clinical use of EMDR as a treatment for PTSD. Consequently, it should be one of the treatment options offered to people with PTSD, and the possibility should be examined of making it more available within the NHS.</p><p id="p-85">However, significant concerns remain regarding the lack of a convincing theoretical model that can explain the effects of EMDR. Also, the function of bilateral stimulation needs to be further evaluated, which might result in future change to the method of EMDR.</p><p id="p-86">The entire field of psychological therapies for PTSD would benefit from further study and clinical scrutiny, and EMDR is no exception.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-28"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-5"><li id="list-item-26">

 <p id="p-1">People with learning disabilities are much more vulnerable to psychiatric illnesses, and will increasingly be accessing generic services. Treatment and management of psychiatric disorders is problematic, primarily because of difficulties in diagnosis, since classificatory systems are standardised on people with average intellectual functioning. This article provides an overview of the clinical implications of anxiety disorders within the context of learning disability.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">People with learning disabilities constitute 2% of the general population. They are a heterogeneous, psychosocially disadvantaged and vulnerable group with a relatively higher prevalence of mental disorders (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-3">Borthwick-Duffy, 1994</a>). Despite difficulties in the diagnosis and classification of psychiatric illnesses in this population (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-15">Fryers, 1997</a>) there is ample evidence that anxiety disorders do occur (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-29">McNally &amp; Ascher, 1987</a>) and they are reported to be at least as common as in the general population, if not more so (<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-25">King <em>et al</em>, 1994</a>; <a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-9">Deb <em>et al</em>, 2001<em>a</em></a>).</p><p id="p-3">The diagnosis, classification and management of mental disorders in people with learning disabilities are often fraught with challenges not encountered in people with average IQ. Within the context of the philosophies of normalisation, equity and social inclusion, health professionals are increasingly called upon to assess and treat learning-disabled individuals, often in crisis. Frequently, they exhibit challenging behaviour as a means of coping with frustration, anxiety and stress (<a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-36">Menalescino, 1977</a>). It is therefore essential that all mental health professionals acquire the fundamental skills needed at the interface of learning disability and psychiatric disorders, underpinned where appropriate by access to specialist services. Here we explore these key issues and implications for clinical practice with relation to anxiety disorders.</p><p id="p-4">Anxiety is a universal human experience. It is a distressing emotion, consisting of both psychological and somatic manifestations and hyperarousal. It is frequently accompanied by behavioural reactions (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-16">Hoen-Saric <em>et al</em>, 1995</a>). At optimal levels it is normal, motivational and protective, helpful in coping with adversity (the Yerkes&#x2013;Dodson law; <a id="xref-ref-59-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-59">Yerkes &amp; Dodson, 1906</a>). Anxiety differs from fear, in that fear is a focused and direct response to a specific event or object that the person is consciously aware of. The DSM&#x2013;IV&#x2013;TR defines anxiety as:</p><p id="p-5">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">&#x2018;the apprehensive anticipation of future danger or misfortune accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria or somatic symptoms of tension. The focus of anticipated danger may be external or internal&#x2019; (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-1">American Psychiatric Association, 2000</a>).</q>
 </p><p id="p-7">Anxiety disorder, or pathological anxiety, occurs when the intensity or duration of anxiety is disproportionate to the potential for harm, or in the absence of recognisable threat to the individual. It involves increased levels of arousal, which has the effect of disorganising rather than facilitating an individual&#x2019;s performance.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Prevalence</h2><p id="p-8">Anxiety ranks among the most common categories of mental disorder reported in large-scale epidemiological studies within the general population (<a id="xref-ref-47-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-47">Robins &amp; Regier, 1991</a>); <a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-19">Jenkins, 1997</a>). In primary care, anxiety and depression account for 80% of consultations for mental health problems (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-4">Cooper, 1972</a>). Untreated, they are costly to both the individual and society. Comorbidity is also a significant problem: about 75% of individuals with an anxiety disorder meet criteria for at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder (<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-23">Kessler <em>et al</em>, 1994</a>).</p><p id="p-9">In people with learning disabilities anxiety disorders are well recognised (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-2">Bailey &amp; Andrews, 2003</a>), may be underreported (<a id="xref-ref-46-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-46">Reiss <em>et al</em>, 1982</a>) and underdiagnosed (<a id="xref-ref-57-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-57">Veerhoven &amp; Tuinier 1997</a>). In a sample of learning-disabled people, <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-5">Cooper (1997)</a> found higher rates of anxiety disorders in the elderly individuals than in the younger age groups. A study cohort comparing people with learning disabilities with the general population revealed significantly higher rates of phobic disorder in the former (<a id="xref-ref-9-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-9">Deb <em>et al,</em> 2001<em>a</em></a>). A literature review (<a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-44">Raghavan, 1997</a>) revealed a similar if not higher prevalence of generalised anxiety disorder in people with learning disabilities. Significant comorbidity was also reported in a study by <a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-31">Masi <em>et al</em>(2000)</a> in learning-disabled adolescents. Anxiety disorders were identified as more prevalent in individuals with self-injurious behaviour than in those without such behaviour (<a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-40">Moss <em>et al</em>, 2000</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Diagnosis and classification</h2><p id="p-10">Anxiety disorders include panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, generalised anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder, and acute and post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). Accurate diagnosis is central to the effective management of these conditions (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>). Frequently, comorbid disorders such as depression can make the presentation and diagnosis confusing, even in the general population.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Difficulties of psychiatric diagnosis in people with learning disabilities</strong></h3>

 <p id="p-19">intellectual distortion &#x2013; emotional symptoms may be difficult to elicit because of deficits in abstract thinking and in receptive and expressive language skills; for example the phrase &#x2018;butterflies in the stomach&#x2019; might not be understood;</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-6">
 <p id="p-20">psychosocial masking &#x2013; limited social experiences can influence the content of psychiatric symptoms; for example mania may present as a grandiose belief that the individual can drive a car;</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-7">
 <p id="p-21">cognitive disintegration &#x2013; a decreased ability to tolerate stress can lead to anxiety-induced decompensation (sometimes misinterpreted as psychosis);</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-8">
 <p id="p-22">baseline exaggeration &#x2013; the severity or frequency of chronic maladaptive behaviour may increase after onset of psychiatric illness.</p>
 </li></ul><p id="p-23">Another factor that may contribute to difficulties experienced by clinicians is diagnostic overshadowing, a tendency in the clinician to overlook symptoms of mental illness, attributing them to learning disability (<a id="xref-ref-46-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-46">Reiss <em>et al</em>, 1982</a>).</p><p id="p-24">In people with learning disabilities, the clinical utility of the ICD&#x2013;10 and DSM&#x2013; IV&#x2013;TR in diagnosing anxiety disorders is limited (<a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-50">Ruedrich <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>; <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-6">Cooray <em>et al</em>, 2005</a>). This is because diagnostic criteria are firmly entrenched in language-based phenomenology, validated on individuals with average intellectual functioning. Currently, the evidence base relating to anxiety disorders in people with learning disabilities is poor, further compounded by difficulties in carrying out robust research (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-42">Oliver <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>). Most studies use some form of modified criteria, with a resultant lack of consistency.</p><p id="p-25">Endeavours to improve diagnostic practice have led to the development of guidelines (<a id="xref-ref-51-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-51">Rush &amp; Frances, 2000</a>; <a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-10">Deb <em>et al</em>, 2001<em>b</em></a>) and a number of informant and self-report assessment instruments of psychopathology, some of which are listed in Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>.

 </li></ul>
 </div><p id="p-31">To address the problems of classification, a new consensus-based system reflecting expert opinion, the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychiatric Disorders for Use with Adults with Learning Disabilities/Mental Retardation (DC&#x2013;LD), has been developed (<a id="xref-ref-49-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-49">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2001</a>). This provides operationalised diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorders for use with adults with moderate, severe or profound learning disabilities. It may also be used to complement the ICD&#x2013;10 or DSM&#x2013;IV&#x2013;TR in adults with mild learning disabilities.</p><p id="p-32">Generally, all criteria for anxiety disorders in ICD&#x2013;10 or DSM&#x2013;IV&#x2013;TR can be applied validly and reliably in people with mild-to-moderate learning disability (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-32">Masi <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>; <a id="xref-ref-55-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-55">Stavrakaki, 2002</a>). In those with severe-to-profound disability, psychiatric assessments must be modified within the context of limitations in cognitive function, using simple spoken language, pictures and sign language. Collateral information from a primary caregiver familiar with the individual is essential. The interview must be unhurried, allowing sufficient time to give an account of events. Questions and responses may need to be repeated and rechecked. People with learning disabilities are suggestible and when presented with a choice of alternatives may agree or repeat the last words of the questionner&#x2019;s sentence. Consequently, leading questions must be avoided.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Effects of learning disability on the presentation of the clinical features of anxiety</h2><p id="p-33">The clinical features of anxiety have cognitive, physiological, psychological and behavioural components. Psychological and cognitive elements may present as fearful anticipation, irritability, concentration and memory problems, repetitive worrying thoughts, fear and, in extreme instances, fully fledged panic. Physiological manifestations include dry mouth, difficulty in swallowing, flushing, sweating, pallor, palpitations, tremor, hyperventilation, chest pain/tightness, headache, backache, fatigue, muscle tension, diarrhoea, increased urinary frequency, paraesthesia, heightened startle response and insomnia. Avoidance is a common behavioural manifestation of anxiety. Chronologically, anxiety can be episodic, continuous or stress related.</p><p id="p-34">Descriptions of key diagnostic concepts of anxiety require a certain level of IQ and linguistic skills, particularly with relation to more complex subjective cognitive phenomena. <a id="xref-ref-35-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-35">Matson <em>et al</em>, 1997</a> concluded that when anxiety cannot be expressed, especially in people with more severe degrees of learning disability, it might manifest as a behavioural disorder. However, this may be non-specific and may be a reflection of other triggers such as the environment. It is important to distinguish between behavioural disorders and abnormal behaviours that are the result of an underlying mental illness. In diagnosising anxiety, <a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-24">Khreim &amp; Mikkelson (1997)</a> highlighted the need to place relatively greater emphasis on phenomena such as agitation, screaming, crying, withdrawal, regressive/clingy behaviour or freezing, all of which could be interpreted as manifestations of fear.</p><p id="p-35">In people with severe and profound learning disability, subjective elements of the diagnostic criteria for anxiety are difficult, if not impossible, to apply. The clinician must therefore rely on signs (observed behaviours) rather than on self-reported distress and on the diagnosis postulated from observations made by primary caregivers. The application of objective equivalents in lieu of subjective criteria, as well as unofficial pragmatic modifications to the DSM and ICD classificatory systems, may be justifiable in such instances. This has prompted clinicians to interpret diagnostic criteria in terms of behavioral correlates that reflect the verbal components of the relevant anxiety disorders (Table 1<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#T2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="table pos-float" id="T2"><div class="table-inline"></div><div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label"><strong>Table 1</strong> </span> <p id="p-92" class="first-child"><strong>Behavioural correlates of anxiety symptoms in learning disability</strong></p></div></div><p id="p-36">These issues might best be addressed by the official modification of the DSM and ICD diagnostic criteria for anxiety to tailor them to adults with learning disabilities, as has already been done for the child and adolescent population.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>Risk factors</h2><p id="p-37">People with learning disabilities frequently contend with a lifetime of adversity, inadequate social supports and poor coping skills. These factors contribute to increased vulnerability to stressful life events, which may trigger anxiety disorders. <a id="xref-ref-23-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-23">Kessler <em>et al</em>(1994)</a> reported that all types of mental disorder, including anxiety, decline with increasing educational level. Current psychological models of anxiety tend to incorporate the role of the individual&#x2019;s vulnerability, which includes both genetic (<a id="xref-ref-52-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-52">Smoller &amp; Tsuang, 1998</a>; Kendler <em>et al</em>, 2001) and acquired predispositions (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-7">Coplan <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>). Some genetic causes of learning disability have associations with anxiety, for example: fragile-X syndrome is associated with social anxiety disorder; Rubinstein&#x2013;Taybi and Prader&#x2013;Willi syndromes with obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder (<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-26">Levitas &amp; Reid, 1998</a>); and Williams syndrome with anxiety (<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-13">Einfeld <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>) and phobias (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-12">Dykens, 2003</a>). <a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-17">Hyman <em>et al</em>(2002)</a> noted significantly high compulsive behaviour in Cornelia de Lange syndrome.</p><p id="p-38">Studies on types of fear reported in this population demonstrate similarities between children and adults of equivalent mental age, highlighting the developmental perspective (<a id="xref-ref-56-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-56">Sternlicht, 1979</a>; <a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-11">Duff, 1981</a>; <a id="xref-ref-43-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-43">Pickersgill <em>et al</em>, 1994</a>). For example individuals with moderate learning disability experience fears of: animals, thunder and ghosts (preoperational thinking), and physical injuries (concrete operational), mirroring normal Piagetian transition in non-learning disabled children. However, in childhood, anxieties and phobias might also occur as transient phenomena, integral to normal early development.</p><p id="p-39">The psychological basis underpinning anxiety includes psychodynamic (anxiety perceived as an expression of unresolved conflict), cognitive (role of individual&#x2019;s perceptions of stressful events in aetiology of anxiety) and behavioural (role of learning, e.g. through classical conditioning and vicarious or observational learning) theories. <a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-18">Ingram <em>et al</em>(1998)</a> reported that people with anxiety frequently have negative cognitions.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Treatment</h2><p id="p-40">The treatment for anxiety disorders in people with learning disabilities broadly parallels that in the rest of the population (Box 3<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).

Desensitisation and exposure therapy are effective management strategies in obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder and social phobia. Some studies suggest that optimum results are achieved by combining psychological and pharmacological interventions (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-14">Fineberg &amp; Drummond, 1995</a>; <a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-20">Kandel, 1999</a>).

 <p id="p-42">A.M., a 29-year-old man with moderate learning disabilities and Down&#x2019;s syndrome (trisomy chromosome 21) was taken to his local accident and emergency department in a distressed and agitated state, having physically attacked his paid carer during a community trip in a car. Once in the hospital he presented as calm and appropriate in his behaviour.</p>
 <p id="p-43">He was initially unable to give an explanation of his earlier distress, but it was elicited from him that he had a 2-year history of becoming nervous in certain situations, for example while travelling, particularly on long car journeys. He would worry about being involved in an accident and being unable to escape from the vehicle. Although not describing subjective feelings of &#x2018;anxiety&#x2019;, on direct questioning, he reported experiencing autonomic symptoms of anxiety at such times, including sweating, tremor and palpitations. He denied persistently depressed mood, and did not have any biological features of a mood disorder.</p>
 <p id="p-44">Collateral history was obtained from his mother. It transpired that the onset of his anxiety symptoms correlated with a number of bereavements of significant people in his life over the previous 4 years. Moreover, he had become so nervous in social situations that he was living an extremely restricted lifestyle, avoiding such situations. He had never previously experienced a panic attack.</p>
 <p id="p-45">Panic disorder with agoraphobia was diagnosed. A referral was made to the local learning disability psychiatric team. A.M. was reluctant to take medication (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), but engaged successfully with psychological treatment of his anxiety disorder.</p>
 </div><p id="p-46">In people with mild or borderline learning disability and anxiety disorders, evidence based on case studies demonstrates the effectiveness of cognitive&#x2013;behavioural therapy (<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-28">Lindsay <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>; <a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-27">Lindsay, 1999</a>). The core principles of cognitive therapy may require modification to meet the abilities of the individual. Evidence relating to the long-term outcome of these interventions is unavailable, although they are likely to be beneficial.</p><p id="p-47">Training and education in relaxation techniques is also helpful for those with mild, moderate or severe learning disability. <a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-30">Martin <em>et al</em>(1998)</a> reported a successful outcome with relation to achieving relaxation in individuals with severe-to-profound learning disability using multisensory stimulation (Snoezelen environment).</p><p id="p-48">The pharmacological treatment of anxiety, targeted at achieving maximum gains from the lowest effective dose and with minimum adverse effects include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants. People with learning disabilities may not be able to report adverse effects. Any resultant impairment of cognitive and psycho-motor abilities may have profound implications for behaviour and general functioning.</p><p id="p-49">In view of their potential adverse effects benzodiazepines should be considered only for short-term (no more than 4 weeks) treatment of acute, disabling anxiety which is causing significant distress, while medium- or long-term strategies are instituted. A minority with intractable anxiety may benefit from long-term treatment, which should not be denied (<a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#ref-48">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1997</a>).</p><p id="p-50">In generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder, panic disorder, PTSD and social phobia, SSRIs may be used as first-line treatment. Treatment with SNRIs such as venlafaxine, which is effective in generalised anxiety disorder, should be supervised by specialist mental health medical practitioners. Tricyclics may be used as second-line intervention for all of these conditions with the exception of social phobia. Other pharmacological treatments with a weaker evidence base or which are less well tolerated include buspirone (generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder) and antipsychotics (quetiapine or ris-peridone as antidepressant augmentation for obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder). The choice of treatment ultimately should be a consequence of the assessment process and shared decision-making, with emphasis on safety, tolerability and the patient&#x2019;s preferences within the context of best available evidence.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-6"><h2>Key points</h2><p id="p-51">Box 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-4-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/355#boxed-text-4"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> summarises key learning points to be taken from this article.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-4"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 4</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Learning points</strong></h3>

 <p id="p-1">There is increasing concern about the level of violence within mental healthcare settings. In this article I review what is known on this subject, discuss the relationship between mental disorder and violence and summarise the different ways to prevent and manage violence. When planning strategies to prevent violence in such settings it is important to consider not only patient risk factors but also risk factors in the environment. Staff need to have all the possible techniques for managing violent behaviour available to them in order to weigh up the risks and benefits for any specific patient in any particular situation.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Despite public concern about violence perpetrated by those with mental disorders, the number of homicides in the UK carried out by people with mental disorders has remained constant over the past 38 years as the total number of homicides has increased (<a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-21">Taylor &amp; Gunn, 1999</a>). There is no evidence that the killing of strangers has increased. Evidence does suggest that rates of all types of violence in mentally disordered offenders have increased since the 1970s, but this is matched by the rise in violence in community controls (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-12">Mullen, 1997</a>). There are high rates of mental disorder among prisoners, and people with schizophrenia are more likely than controls to be convicted of any offence, including violence (<a id="xref-ref-12-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-12">Mullen, 1997</a>).

 </div><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Violence in in-patient settings</h2><p id="p-14">The risk of a particular violent incident happening at a particular time and place depends on the combination of the characteristics and current state of the perpetrator, the set of circumstances at the time, victim availability and the characteristics of that victim. Thus, factors other than the perpetrator should be taken into consideration when planning the prevention and/or management of violence. Indeed, many service users believe that external factors are more important precipitants of their violent behaviour than are internal ones (<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-13">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2004</a>).</p><p id="p-15">The literature describing in-patient violence has been reviewed extensively by the Royal College of Psychiatrists in its clinical practice guidelines on the management of imminent violence (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-17">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1998</a>).

Most studies are observational, without control groups. However, the factors observed to be associated with in-patient violence can be divided into patient factors, situational/environmental factors and victim factors. There is some evidence that assault rates in hospitals reflect the level of violence in the population they serve (<a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-24">Walker &amp; Caplan, 1993</a>).</p><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><h3>Environmental risk factors</h3><p id="p-19">The environment is very important, as it can be manipulated to reduce the risk of violence.

 </div><p id="p-33">High-morale wards &#x2013; those with experienced trained staff and good leadership &#x2013; report lower levels of violence. Issues that do not appear to have been addressed adequately in the literature but seem to be relevant are: optimal ward layout; optimal patient numbers; ideal staffing ratio; ideal proportion of staff with professional mental health training; optimal ward observation policy; optimal diagnostic mix of patients; the role of substance misuse policies; and the role of prosecution policies. There is probably no single &#x2018;answer&#x2019; to these issues and each will need to be tailored to the setting and profile of the patients being cared for.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Prevention of violence</h2><p id="p-35">The main aim of managing violence is to prevent it where possible.</p><div id="sec-6" class="subsection"><h3>Patient factors in prevention</h3><p id="p-36">Staff in all settings need to be adequately trained in clinical risk assessment so that they can determine whether individuals present a risk and, if they do, what may happen, to whom and in which circumstances. This allows a coherent management plan to be implemented that reduces the likelihood of that set of circumstances occurring. One approach is to screen for risk using a simple checklist and carry out a more detailed risk assessment if an individual appears to present a potential risk on the basis of the screen.</p><p id="p-37">Risk assessment involves taking a thorough history that includes the patient&#x2019;s personal history, past and present mental state, substance misuse and social functioning and looks at risk factors for violence. Particular attention needs to be paid to any past acts of violence, looking for the circumstances in which they arose, any early warning signs and any effective interventions. Risk is dynamic and must be regularly reassessed. A good risk assessment requires access to good-quality information from a range of sources. Thus, patient notes should be available at all times, including out of hours, and there should be robust inter-agency information-sharing protocols. Structured clinical judgement tools such as the 20-item Historical, Clinical and Risk Management (HCR&#x2013;20) scale (<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-25">Webster <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>) can be very useful in clinical practice for assessing patients deemed at risk, as they provide a systematic and comprehensive clinical risk assessment on which to base a risk management plan. Research suggests that such instruments may increase predictive accuracy compared with clinical judgement alone (<a id="xref-ref-13-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-13">National Institute for Clinical Excellence, 2004</a>).</p><p id="p-38">The most effective preventive measures are treating the patient&#x2019;s mental disorder effectively and tackling substance misuse, both at patient and ward level.

This usually involves restraining the patient in some way, i.e. constraining their movement so they are unable to act violently. Restraining methods can broadly be separated into geographical restraint (moving the patient to a quieter place, a more secure ward or seclusion), physical restraint and chemical restraint (rapid tranquillisation). All should only be used as a last resort. Each of these interventions has rare but potentially fatal complications. The risks are increased by the high physical morbidity of psychiatric patients. However, avoiding these interventions altogether is not an option if serious injury to others is to be prevented.

Because it involves a severe restriction of a patient&#x2019;s liberty, there are strict guidelines to be followed. The code of practice states clearly that seclusion must only be used as a last resort and must never be used as part of a treatment plan or as a punishment. It must not be used as an alternative to having adequate staffing levels and highly trained staff.</p><p id="p-73">The main risks associated with seclusion are suicide and, for patients medicated before being moved, the risks associated with rapid tranquillisation. These are best dealt with by having clear protocols for the observation and physical monitoring of patients in seclusion.</p><p id="p-74">The Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x2019; clinical practice guidelines hypothesise that seclusion may be unnecessary if restraint is properly applied. However, in the absence of robust research it seems premature to ban the use of one of the ways of dealing with acute violence, especially as some studies show that most staff injuries occur during physical restraint.</p><p id="p-75">Furthermore, both physical restraint, especially if prolonged, and medication carry significant physical risks. Therefore seclusion might be preferable in some circumstances, for example to avoid prolonged restraint or for an over-aroused patient who is already being treated with high doses of medication or for whom restraint brings back memories of past abuse.</p><p id="p-76">Obviously, for individuals who cannot cope with being alone, seclusion might not be the best option as it may increase the likelihood of suicidal behaviour.</p><p id="p-77">For further reading on the issues surrounding seclusion see <a id="xref-ref-1-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-1">Beer <em>et al</em>(2001)</a>.</p></div><div id="sec-16" class="subsection"><h4>Physical restraint</h4><p id="p-78">In the UK, when discussing physical restraint we are usually referring to trained staff using recognised techniques of physical contact to hold a patient and restrict their movement, thus preventing them from causing injury.

Like seclusion, it should only be used as a last resort. Staff restraining patients must be properly trained. This is to prevent injury to themselves and, particularly, to the patient: physical restraint can sometimes be associated with sudden death (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-15">O&#x2019;Halloran &amp; Frank, 2000</a>; <a id="xref-ref-14-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-14">Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire Strategic Health Authority, 2003</a>). The exact mechanisms are unclear but it seems that asphyxia, especially if an individual is restrained in a prone position, plays a large role. Other factors increasing the risk are heart disease, over-arousal, struggling, obesity and drug effects, all of which are particularly relevant in a psychiatric population (<a id="xref-ref-15-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-15">O&#x2019;Halloran &amp; Frank, 2000</a>).

Police assistance may be requested if staff cannot contain a particularly violent incident or the police may be contacted after the event, to discuss whether to prosecute the patient. If a patient becomes violent, it is important that all involved are very clear about their roles. It is helpful for mental health organisations to develop joint working protocols with their local police to clarify in advance what the police are and are not able or willing to provide in the way of assistance during a violent incident. There is a move nationally to encourage all trusts to develop such protocols.</p><div id="sec-20" class="subsection"><h3>Prosecution of psychiatric in-patients</h3><p id="p-108">Prosecution of in-patients has historically been very difficult because of reluctance on the part of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to view it as in the public interest. However, prosecution is now more common owing to the advent of the National Health Service&#x2019;s policy of &#x2018;zero tolerance&#x2019; of violent behaviour, the aim of which is to reduce violence in all heathcare settings.</p><p id="p-109">Prosecution is clearly not feasible or desirable in all cases of violence in mental healthcare settings. It can damage the therapeutic relationship and may not be necessary if the patient was very ill at the time and is now making a good recovery. However, in some circumstances it can be of value: it might, for example, change the patient&#x2019;s legal status in a clinically helpful way; it can aid future risk assessment if offences are officially on record; and it helps some patients to start taking some responsibility for their behaviour. Sometimes the local CPS needs to be educated about these potential benefits. Prosecution also sends out the message that the safety of mental healthcare professionals is taken seriously by the wider society.</p><p id="p-110">The prosecution process runs most smoothly where the healthcare organisation has developed a policy in conjunction with the local police and CPS to determine which incidents will be reported, what information will be exchanged and what response the organisation can expect.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-21"><h2>Violence in community settings</h2><p id="p-111">Although most violence perpetrated by people with mental disorders (and, indeed, by those without) occurs within the domestic environment, the vast majority of the literature on the prevention and management of imminent violence in this group relates to in-patient settings. However, over recent decades more and more psychiatric care has been delivered in a community setting. The introduction of home treatment/crisis intervention teams has meant that increasingly people who are acutely ill are being managed at home. Violence encountered by community mental health teams, particularly during domiciliary visits, can be more difficult to manage, as the full range of interventions and a highly trained response team may not be available. Also, the patient&#x2019;s risk and response to different situations may be less well known.</p><p id="p-112">Staff should be trained in personal safety methods such as thorough risk assessment in order to anticipate potential violence, and basic breakaway and de-escalation techniques. Teams should develop clear policies on how to deal with issues such as alarms sounding in consultation rooms; who will respond to an incident; protocols to ensure the safety of home visits; home visiting in pairs if necessary; and protocols agreed with the local police, clarifying when they will assist with Mental Health Act 1983 assessments. <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-6">Galloway (2002)</a> has written in more detail about safety in the community in a previous issue of <em>APT</em>.</p><p id="p-113">Research suggests that staff safety in interview rooms in all mental healthcare settings remains inadequate in many situations (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/362#ref-18">Sipos <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>).

 <p id="p-1">Adverse effects of psychotropic medication on breast-fed infants have not been studied in controlled and systematic research. Existing information comes from small case series and single case reports. These limited data confirm that psychotropics are excreted into breast milk and that the infant is exposed to them. In recent decades sufficient data have accumulated to allow psychiatrists to prescribe tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, conventional antipsychotics, carbamazepine and sodium valproate to breast-feeding mothers with safety. There are not sufficient data on atypical antipsychotics to allow women to breast-feed safely. Mothers on clozapine or lithium should not breast-feed. It is good practice to recommend that breast-feeding mothers requiring psychotropic medication be on a low dose of one single drug. Future research taking account of maternal mental health, psychopharmacological factors, infant physiological environment and individualised risk/benefit assessment will yield clearer responses to this complex issue.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">The physical and psychological benefits of breast-feeding for the mother and the infant are numerous and range from improved and stronger bonding to better immunological protection. Breast-fed infants have fewer episodes of middle-ear and urinary tract infections and lower mortality rates than bottle-fed babies (<a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-36">Nulman <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>). Breast milk contains nucleotides and enzymes that promote digestion and absorption of nutrients. Breast-feeding has been associated with better cognitive functioning and better performance on IQ measures at age 7&#x2013;8 years (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-16">Fergusson <em>et al</em>, 1982</a>; <a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-28">Lucas <em>et al</em>, 1992</a>).</p><p id="p-3">For the mother, breast-feeding causes oxytocin and prolactin release, precipitates postnatal uterine involution and suppresses ovulatory cycles.</p><p id="p-4">Breast-feeding has been successfully promoted in recent decades and a significantly large group of women now believe in its benefits and enquire about the possibilities of breast-feeding even when they are on psychotropic medication. It is the duty of the prescribing psychiatrist to guide the mother, the carers, the community mental health team, the general practitioner (GP), the obstetricians and the paediatricians through the intricacies of this complex area of psychopharmacology, in which there is an increasing interest but only scant research, few case studies and limited publications.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Pharmacokinetics of psychotropics in breast milk</h2><p id="p-5">Researchers need information on four factors in order to understand problems related to breast-feeding by mothers taking psychotropic medication: the prescribed dose; the level of the drug in the mother&#x2019;s blood plasma; the level in the breast milk; and the levels in the infant&#x2019;s serum. The amount of drug excreted in the milk is important in evaluating any drug-induced toxicity in the infant.</p><p id="p-6">The medication&#x2019;s diffusion across membranes, its molecular weight and its lipophilicity each play an important role in determining the amount that enters the breast milk (<a id="xref-ref-36-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-36">Nulman <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>).</p><p id="p-7">The milk that comes out towards the end of a feed (hind milk) has a higher concentration of lipids than the thinner foremilk. Consequently, hind milk will contain a greater concentration of any lipid-soluble drug. Colostrum, produced only during the first few days after birth, has a higher protein level and will therefore contain a greater concentration of protein-bound drugs.</p><p id="p-8">To evaluate infant exposure to a drug the concentration of the medication or its metabolite are measured simultaneously in the mother&#x2019;s plasma and breast milk. A milk/plasma ratio greater than 1 suggests a high likelihood that the infant will be exposed to the drug (<a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-44">Suri <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>). However, it is important to note that a milk/plasma ratio calculated on one single occasion and independent of other risks may not be sufficiently significant. There are other important factors such as the drug&#x2019;s dosage and frequency, its pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, and the timing of the dose in relation to the infant&#x2019;s feeding patterns. Taking several measurements at different times of the day may provide a better picture.</p><p id="p-9">Infants metabolise medication transmitted via breast milk, but this varies with each individual. Preterm immature infants are more sensitive and may have immature liver function, and they should therefore not be exposed to any psychotropic medication through the breast milk.</p><p id="p-10">The infants&#x2019; hepatic, cardiac and renal functions should be checked before they are breast-fed by mothers treated with psychotropics.</p><p id="p-11">The infant&#x2019;s stage of development influences the effects of exposure. Most full-term infants have decreased capacity for drug metabolism until the third week of life. Drug metabolism gradually increases, so that by the 8th to the 12th weeks of life the rate is several times faster than in adults. It later decreases, eventually reaching the adult level of metabolism by puberty (<a id="xref-ref-51-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-51">Wisner <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>).</p><p id="p-12">Maximum maternal dosages that will definitely have no affect on the infant have not been established for any psychotropics. Therefore it is not possible to advise on acceptable milk/plasma ratios or safe doses. Likewise, treatment doses below which there are no clinical adverse effects or longitudinal side-effects in the infant have also not been identified. Nevertheless, for psychotropics the arbitrary concentration in the infant&#x2019;s plasma of 10% of the established therapeutic maternal dose is used as the upper threshold where the risks of a particular drug&#x2019;s side-effects are low and treatment is accepted as safe (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-7">Bennett, 1996</a>; <a id="xref-ref-36-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#ref-36">Nulman <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>).</p><p id="p-13">If a mother on psychotropics is breast-feeding, the newborn should be systematically monitored for any possible adverse effects such as drowsiness, hypotonia, rigidity, tremor and withdrawal symptoms.</p><p id="p-14">Follow-up of the infant&#x2019;s progress and milestones is important for the recognition of any side-effects (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/371#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>The follow-up of infants exposed to psychotropic medication</strong></h3>

A number of other factors are important: the reliability of informants, the level of understanding of early warning signs, good rapport with care coordinators and health visitors, and involvement of statutory and voluntary organisations. The amount of medication needed during the pregnancy and the need for monotherapy will play a role in the decision.</p><p id="p-89">The physical health and maturity of the infant are clearly important. It is also essential that the mother should be well enough to look after her newborn and not go through a crisis and need hospitalisation. It may be more important to give the mother the amount and number of psycho-tropics necessary to keep her well in the community with her baby than to allow her to remain under-treated while breast-feeding.

And with the exception of clozapine and lithium salts, which are clearly contraindicated, no single agent seems to be of greater risk than others.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-5"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 5</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Key points</strong></h3>
 <ul class="list-unord" id="list-5"><li id="list-item-20">
 <p id="p-93">The decision to prescribe antipsychotics to breast-feeding women should depend on individual risk/benefit analysis</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-21">
 <p id="p-94">The current available research does not allow any absolute and clear recommendation because much of the work on psychotropic medication in breast-feeding is limited to single case reports, small series and naturalistic data collection</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-22">
 <p id="p-95">Causes and consequences of different adverse events are not yet widely studied</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-23">
 <p id="p-96">Non-psychiatric professionals, especially health visitors, need to be trained to recognise adverse events</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-24">
 <p id="p-97">There is a need for further research and accumulation of experience</p>
 </li></ul>
 </div><p id="p-98">It is also well established that none of the drugs discussed above is established as being completely free of side-effects. Therefore all drugs should be viewed with caution before breast-feeding. Still, there are documented differences between drugs within the same class and there is no class action in relation to breast-feeding.</p><p id="p-99">All psychotropics are secreted into the breast milk but concentrations and effects can vary. The results of earlier clinical reports and case studies and the more recent studies with larger patient samples lead to the tentative conclusion that, for most psycho-tropics, low doses of a single drug are relatively safe during breast-feeding.</p><p id="p-100">The decision to breast-feed must be made jointly by the mother, the family, the psychiatrist and the health visitor involved in the mother&#x2019;s psychiatric management. The benefits of breast-feeding for the mother and the infant should outweigh the risks of exposing the infant to small doses of the medication. Mothers who need to be on two or more psycho-tropics simultaneously or who have to take medication at the upper end of the recommended dose range should be advised not to breast-feed. Women on atypical antipsychotics are also advised not to breast-feed because of the paucity of experience with these medications. It is essential that infants are monitored by health visitors and paediatricians for any possible adverse events.</p><p id="p-101">Breast-feeding while taking psychotropic medication is an important issue that has not received the attention it deserves. It is clear that there is very limited research and data on the subject and most of the information comes from a small number of studies based on a few cases or case reports. With the revived interest in perinatal psychiatry, I hope that there will be a revival of the subject and controlled and systematic research will be able to address some of the questions yet to be resolved.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-35"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-6"><li id="list-item-25">

Their well-timed article provides an excellent overview of the various studies to date that have been associated with reducing the risk of the disease.</p><p id="p-2">The prevalence of dementia is expected to increase considerably over the next 20 years, and the first-degree relatives of someone with dementia are at increased risk of developing the disease. I therefore wish to draw attention to the importance of increasing the awareness of the illness among family members.</p><p id="p-3">I conduct memory clinics and on numerous occasions family members of patients have approached me, apprehensive about their own risk of dementia. I wonder how many of us make use of the opportunity in clinics to provide information leaflets, discuss risk factors and inform relatives of measures that can be taken to minimise their risk. However small that risk may be, the opportunity to educate about healthy lifestyle options and risk factor reduction should not be lost.</p><p id="p-4">Vascular risk factors are associated not only with vascular dementia but also with Alzheimer&#x2019;s dementia (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/5/380#ref-3">Stewart <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>), which together account for the lion&#x2019;s share of all dementias. There has been considerable evidence to show that by reducing these risk factors, dementia can be delayed, or even avoided. The general importance of vascular health is already frequently reinforced by medical staff and the media. However, educating relatives of people with dementia specifically on vascular risk factors for the disease and also on the importance of neuro-protection and building up neuronal reserves will further help families to be proactive in preventing dementia and may also make it easier for them to cope with their current situation.</p></div></div><hr class="rdb-page-break" /><div><div class="article fulltext-view"><p id="p-1">Training, and identifying and maintaining standards for its delivery, are key functions of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. Over the past 30 years the College can look at its record with pride: it has set standards that are fairly similar across different countries and has done so with a mixture of gentle persuasion, approbation and warning of the likely outcome of losing accreditation. This has been a useful strategy in establishing standards and ensuring that they are met. However, changes are now necessary for a number of reasons. Psychiatric services have changed beyond recognition. Mental asylums have been replaced with community-based mental health centres and different types of acute services such as home treatment and assertive outreach. The role of the consultant has also changed and revalidation and reaccreditation are likely to play a significant part in the personal development of the next generation of consultants. Advances in information technology have also meant that a changing set of skills has become necessary for delivery of services in the 21st century.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Generators of change</h2><p id="p-2">Impetus for change in the College&#x2019;s training structures has come from three directions. First, the introduction of the European Working Time Directive has meant that traditional methods of delivering training are no longer appropriate. Second, the Modernising Medical Careers project (<a href="http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/home">http://www.mmc.nhs.uk/pages/home</a>) has introduced a second year of foundation training, ostensibly to give trainees exposure to a larger number of specialties and consequently a wider career choice. The third and single most important change, which will affect all the medical Royal Colleges, has been the establishment of the national Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB), charged with monitoring and maintaining standards of postgraduate medical education.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>The Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board</h2><p id="p-3">Established 2 years ago, PMETB &#x2018;went live&#x2019; on 30 September 2005. It replaces the Specialist Training Authority (STA) and the Joint Committee for General Practice Training (JCPTGP). One of the primary tasks of the Board is to ensure that examinations are fit for purpose. The Board is also responsible for ensuring that assessments of doctors in training are curriculum-based, fair, reliable, feasible and cost-effective. The purpose of each assessment must be specified and made available to all stakeholders, and the level and sequence of assessments along a career pathway must be laid out. Feedback must be given and any weaknesses in the trainees&#x2019;s performance must be addressed in further training. Assessment methods must be transparent and in the public domain. Lay assessors must be involved in the development of assessment.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Changes within the College</h2><p id="p-4">The Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x2019; response to change has been sustained and appropriate. The two forthcoming changes that will have greatest effect on the College are the introduction of a single unified training grade and PMETB&#x2019;s regulation of assessment methods and its inspection of training schemes.</p><p id="p-5">In the autumn of 2007, the current basic and higher specialist grades will be replaced with a single grade covering the full 6 years of training. Consequently, training scheme organisers, postgraduate deans and directors of medical education are being encouraged not to offer long-term contracts to trainees at the present time.</p><p id="p-6">Owing to the requirements of Modernising Medical Careers and the European Working Time Directive, training and its delivery are likely to become modular. The first 2&#xBD; years of the 6-year training will provide exposure to a range of sub-specialties, much as basic training currently does. During the remaining 3&#xBD; years trainees will focus on their chosen specialty, as in current higher training. Accordingly, training for the College&#x2019;s membership examinations (the MRCPsych) will be modular and trainees will be expected to study a number of modules prior to assessment. PMETB is looking into clear entry criteria for all specialties. There will be a knowledge-based assessment, probably at the end of the first year of specialist training in psychiatry. A clinical (possibly OSCE &#x2013; objective structured clinical examination) assessment may be conducted before entry into sub-specialty training. These will be roughly equivalent to the current parts I and II of the MRCPsych examination.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>The new curriculum</h2><p id="p-7">The College has sent its new curriculum for specialist training to PMETB for its informal approval. The framework of the curriculum and its principles have been developed from those underpinning the existing competency-based higher specialist training, with additional features to meet the PMETB&#x2019;s requirements. For our trainees, the focus of learning and of assessments will be the workplace. For our trainers and assessors, the foci of the curriculum and assessment will be performance (what the trainee actually does) and competence (ability successfully to perform a task or procedure). Much more will be expected than the simple recall of knowledge. There is likely to be an end-of-training assessment based on a portfolio, interview and competency-led assessments. There might also be a number of workplace-based assessments, which might include a long case assessment, a number of mini clinical examinations and case-based orals together with assessment of communication and liaison skills. Trainees will have to maintain a portfolio recording acquisition of competencies. Workplace-based assessments would be conducted by educational supervisors rather than by clinical supervisors. The changes in the MRCPsych will focus on fitness of purpose and ensuring that knowledge and competencies are appropriately assessed. After March 2006, PMETB will approve all training schemes.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Potential disadvantages of the training revisions</h2><p id="p-8">The changes to medical training may pose some problems for psychiatry and the College. For example, if there are insufficient posts in foundation year 2, smaller specialties such as psychiatry may suffer because potential trainees may not have had exposure to them and they may miss out on those who have not made up their minds. The single training grade may make it difficult for those who find that they are not suited to psychiatry to switch to another specialty, as each medical Royal College will be expected to have strict entry criteria to its specialties. The proposed changes also have major resource implications that require urgent discussion. It is possible that the role of the medical Royal Colleges will have to alter and that they will have to deliver changes over which they have limited control.</p><p id="p-9">Some of the changes may result in better delivery of training and, eventually, in service development. However, if not carefully monitored and properly resourced, the proposed &#x2018;improvements&#x2019; may land the medical profession in a bigger mess.</p></div></div></div><hr class="rdb-page-break" /><div><div class="article fulltext-view"><p id="p-1">Ten years ago consultant psychiatrist Anne Cremona identified the need for a special interest group for women psychiatrists and also for women patients. Dr Cremona had four children under the age of six and a full-time consultant post. There were already 878 women consultants in the UK but little thought was given to ways of working part-time and flexible training was a new concept (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-10">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 1995</a>). Women in-patients were in mixed wards and the particular needs of women with mental illnesses were generally not considered. The Royal College of Psychiatrists&#x2019; Women in Psychiatry Special Interest Group (WIPSIG) was created with the dual aim of addressing the needs of both women psychiatrists and women patients in mental health services.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Improvements for patients</h2><p id="p-2">What has happened in the intervening 10 years? If we look at women patients there appears to have been some progress. <em>Safety, Privacy and Dignity in Mental Health Units</em> (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-8">NHS Executive, 2000</a>) set a standard to eliminate mixed-gender accommodation for in-patients by 2002. <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-2">The Department of Health&#x2019;s (2002)</a> consultation document <em>Women&#x2019;s Mental Health: Into the Mainstream</em> provided an evidence base to inform and demonstrate the need for gender-sensitive and gender-specific services. <em>Mainstreaming Gender and Women&#x2019;s Mental Health</em> (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-3">Department of Health, 2003</a>) offers an implementation strategy.</p><p id="p-3">These documents have helped to raise the profile of women and mental health, but in adult mental health services the extent of progress is questionable as managers struggle to meet the many competing demands on them. For example, Mind has reported that 2 years after the target date for the elimination of mixed-gender psychiatric accommodation, a quarter of recent and current in-patient respondents had been accommodated on mixed-gender wards and 31% of respondents did not have access to single-gender bathroom facilities (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-7">Mind, 2004</a>). In a survey of acute psychiatric in-patient wards in England in 2004, ward managers reported that 8% of wards lacked separate bathrooms for men and women, 8% lacked separate sleeping areas and 4% lacked separate toilets (<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-13">Sainsbury Centre for Mental Health, 2005</a>).</p><p id="p-4">There has been more recognition of the difficulties facing women in forensic mental health services, given the specific needs of women offenders with a mental illness. This has led to a reorganisation of the structure and provision of services for women in lower levels of security, with women-only units in some parts of the country.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>And for psychiatrists?</h2><p id="p-5">By August of this year, membership of WIPSIG had grown to 1277, including 83 men (Royal College of Psychiatrists, Membership Manager, personal communication, 2005). This mirrors the increase in the number of women psychiatrists in the UK and Ireland. Now, overall, 40% of College members in the UK and Ireland are women, with 45% of basic specialist trainees, 48% of higher specialist trainees, 53% of non-consultant career grade psychiatrists and 36% of consultants women. One in five specialist registrars in psychiatry trains flexibly (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-9">Ramsay, 2004</a>).</p><p id="p-6">In 2003 over 60% of all accepted applicants to medical school in the UK were women (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-1">British Medical Association, 2004</a>). In the future, with the increasing proportion of female medical students it seems reasonable to predict further increases in the number of women trainees and consultants in psychiatry. With women becoming the majority, what should we make of their needs?</p><p id="p-7">We could argue that women in psychiatry are doing well. In the 2004 College membership examinations (the MRCPsych) women performed significantly better than their male peers (odds ratio 1.63). Looking at the highest echelons of the College, our President, Registrar and Treasurer are all women. The College is committed to improving and developing flexible training and working, and for the past 2 years Alicia Etchegoyen and Jane Marshall have job-shared the new post of National Director of Flexible Training to improve and develop flexible training and working.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Ambitions: the gender divide</h2><p id="p-8">It might appear that the problems women psychiatrists face have disappeared, or at least they are less visible. However, other concerns have been raised. Last summer Carol Black, President of the Royal College of Physicians, was reported in the press as saying</p><p id="p-9">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">&#x2018;The women admitted to medical school do well, they work well and they graduate well. The distinctions go to the women. But then, they start to make choices to balance their family and their lifestyle.&#x2019;</q>
 </p><p id="p-11">Women are not reaching the &#x2018;top of the profession&#x2019;. She warned that within a decade women doctors would outnumber men and that this &#x2018;feminisation&#x2019; of medicine could lead to the profession losing status (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-5">Laurance, 2004</a>).</p><p id="p-12">Do women psychiatrists lack the commitment of their male colleagues to take on the extra but essential roles necessary to maintain the position of doctors in the healthcare system as they opt out of committee work and other non-clinical roles? It is hard to be sure. The proportion of College Fellows who are women is 23% (arguably a reflection of the lower numbers of women going into psychiatry 15 and more years ago), the number of women medical directors is small, and there are relatively few women professors of psychiatry, 11% of the total in the UK (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-4">Killaspy <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>). Earlier on in their careers, trainees continue to have difficulty in securing funding to train part-time.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>Institutional discrimination?</h2><p id="p-13">WIPSIG was interested in the findings of an external review of College structures commissioned in 2001 to identify any discriminatory practices. The review, conducted by the Centre for Ethnicity and Health at the University of Central Lancashire, highlighted issues surrounding gender equality that the College should address. Former President Mike Shooter set up a gender equality scoping group chaired by Sheila Hollins (herself now President). The group has developed a gender equality statement of intent (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-11">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2004<em>a</em></a>) and is finalising the College action plan. This work is in line with <em>Good Psychiatric Practice</em> (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-12">Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2004<em>b</em></a>), which has highlighted equality issues, stating that the core attributes required for good psychiatric practice include &#x2018;being fully sensitive to gender . . .&#x2019; with a &#x2018;commitment to equality, anti-discriminatory practice and working with diversity&#x2019;.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>The future</h2><p id="p-14">Where does this leave WIPSIG? We believe there are still issues for both women psychiatrists and women patients. Some might appear to be resolving, for example with gender-segregated wards and real increases in the number of women consultants, but professional barriers and difficulties persist, including the so-called glass ceiling. It may be helpful to conceptualise these concerns in terms of a work/home life balance. We know that doctors have been slow to adopt the goals of the Department of Health&#x2019;s Improving Working Lives (IWL) initiative, which led to the appointment of an individual to champion the doctors&#x2019; cause (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#ref-6">MacDonald, 2003</a>). WIPSIG and the gender equality scoping group are now planning to study the career development of psychiatrists from their appointment as senior house officers, to get a clearer picture of the aspirations and needs of both female and male trainees and newly appointed consultants so that we are in the best position to make realistic predictions about future workforce requirements.</p></div><div class="section ref-list" id="ref-list-1"><h2>References</h2><ol class="cit-list ref-use-labels"><li><a class="rev-xref-ref" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/383#xref-ref-1-1" title="View reference in text" id="ref-1">&#x21B5;</a>

These teams, led by community matrons, work across organisational boundaries. The primary objective, and the major criterion of success, is reduction of admissions to acute hospital beds.

Each year eight billion pounds are spent by the National Health Service (NHS) and social services on mental illness (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-8">Layard, 2004</a>). According to the Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-12">Singleton <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>), 16% of adults of working age have a mental illness, and up to a half of these people are seriously ill. Suicide is the second most common cause of death among young people in England (<a id="xref-ref-6-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-6">Dowse, 2003</a>).</p><p id="p-20">There is obviously a clear case for inclusion, and prioritisation, of mental health in the government&#x2019;s programme of reform of health services provision. However, mental health is omitted from the next step in NHS reforms, the Long-term conditions agenda (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-5">Department of Health 2005<em>b</em></a>), as has been pointed out by the NHS Confederation in its briefing paper on long-term conditions (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-10">NHS Confederation, 2005</a>). What are the relevance and implications of this policy for mental health services in the UK? Chronic physical conditions are clearly its focus, and long-term mental illness is barely mentioned.</p><p id="p-21">Although the major psychoses more obviously fit the long-term conditions paradigm, other mental health disorders, for example, obsessive&#x2013;compulsive disorder, chronic depression and a number of comorbid conditions such as personality disorder with substance misuse, can be as crippling, causing long-term disability and affecting quality of life. Better management across the primary and secondary services divide can contribute significantly to suicide prevention and risk management. In the UK, secondary services in adult mental health concentrate almost exclusively on serious mental illness, often because of reduced resources and increasing demand together with problems caused by rising comorbid substance misuse. As a result, primary care practitioners struggle with &#x2018;heart-sink&#x2019; patients, many with chronic depression or personality disorder, both of which contribute significantly to suicide risk in the community.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Links between mental health and physical conditions</h2><div id="sec-5" class="subsection"><h3>Liaison services</h3><p id="p-23">The experience of psychiatric liaison services in acute hospitals also informs us that effective management of treatment adherence for many long-term physical conditions involves joint care plans with both physical and mental health input. With elderly people, prevention of falls is an important part of the management of long-term physical conditions in acute old age wards; but it is important also to realise that many of these individuals also have depression or early dementia, which may not be recognised and given proper treatment.</p><p id="p-24">This is also an opportunity to remind ourselves that a key recommendation of the inquiry into the death of Daksha Emson, a doctor who killed herself and her child, was that joint care plans be organised with both mental health and obstetric services for mothers at risk of severe postnatal depression (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/385#ref-11">North East London Strategic Health Authority, 2003</a>).

 <p id="p-1">Since 2000 assertive outreach has been a requirement of community mental health provision in the UK. This has led to rapid proliferation of assertive community treatment teams offering a pure form of clinical case management to people with severe mental illness. The teams provide intensive support in obtaining material essentials such as food and shelter and place a greater emphasis on social functioning and quality of life than on symptoms. People with psychotic illness with fluctuating mental state and social functioning and poor medication adherence are most likely to benefit. Teams are ideally placed to monitor clozapine treatment in the community. Teams require a broad skills mix, and team members need some competence across a wide range of areas. Teams should include a psychiatrist or have regular access to one. Ideal individual case-loads are 10&#x2013;12 patients. Around-the-clock availability is no longer considered essential, particularly in view of the rise of crisis resolution/home treatment teams.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Assertive community treatment has been around in one form or another for 25 years. During this time it has become the dominant model of specialist assertive outreach to people with severe mental illnesses. It was developed by pioneering psychiatrists in the USA with the explicit aim of helping patients struggling to stay out of hospital to live more successfully in the community. It achieved this by providing them with more intensive support in obtaining the material necessities of life and by placing a greater emphasis on social functioning and quality of life rather than symptoms. When we published our experiences of setting up an assertive community treatment team in this journal 9 years ago (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-18">Kent &amp; Burns, 1996</a>), only a few teams existed in the UK. Our own team was one of four new services assessed by the UK700 study of intensive case management (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-7">Creed <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). At the time, assertive community treatment was much more widely developed in the USA, where teams were grouped under the catchy title of PACT (Programs in Assertive Community Treatment). This all changed when the National Health Service Plan identified assertive outreach as a necessary component of community mental health provision (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-9">Department of Health, 2000</a>). The result has been a very rapid proliferation of assertive community treatment teams in the UK. By April 2004, 270 had been established. In this article, we outline the history of the assertive community treatment model, describe the processes required to run an effective team and the current status of the model as a mental health service intervention in the UK.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Historical development</h2><div id="sec-2" class="subsection"><h3>Training in community living</h3><p id="p-3">Assertive community treatment began with the highly influential &#x2018;training in community living&#x2019; programme developed during the 1970s at the Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison, Wisconsin (<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-20">Marx <em>et al,</em> 1973</a>). This programme sprang from a recognition by Marx and his colleagues, Stein and Test, that contemporaneous community treatments did little more than maintain chronically disabled patients in &#x2018;a tenuous community adjustment on the brink of rehospitalisation&#x2019; (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-27">Stein &amp; Test, 1980</a>). Their programme was an attempt to address the imbalance of care before and after discharge, and was developed with the understanding that an effective community treatment programme must assume responsibility for helping patients to meet all their needs. These needs, they argued, include the material essentials of life such as food, clothing and shelter; coping skills necessary to meet the demands of community living; motivation to persevere in the face of adversity; freedom from pathologically dependent relationships; and support and education of significant others involved with the patient in the community.</p><p id="p-4">The expectation that socially disabled patients would come to the clinician was replaced with the expectation that the clinician would be assertive in delivering care and go to the patient. The assumption that the patient would negotiate the difficult pathways between different caring agencies was replaced with the assumption that the clinician is responsible for ensuring coordination of inter-agency care. The role of the keyworker became pre-eminent, and key-workers assumed responsibility for delivering a greater proportion of direct care to a much smaller number of allocated patients. Care became needs-led and care programmes were designed for each individual patient.</p><p id="p-5">The results of Stein &amp; Test&#x2019;s original randomised controlled study of training in community living remain impressive. Over the first year, 58% of the individuals randomised to standard progressive care were readmitted to a psychiatric hospital compared with 6% of those receiving training in community living. Not only were patients on the training in community living programme more likely to live independently in the community but their clinical state improved, together with their social functioning, likelihood of employment, adherence to medication regimens and, most important of all, their quality of life (<a id="xref-ref-27-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-27">Stein &amp; Test, 1980</a>). These gains were achieved without additional burden on families or other informal carers and (despite the intensity of intervention) at no extra cost because of the saving on beds (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-29">Test &amp; Stein, 1980</a>; <a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-32">Weisbrod <em>et al,</em> 1980</a>). These results have been interpreted to suggest that training in community living was significantly less expensive than standard progressive care. When funding for the programme was withdrawn, all of the gains were lost. This last very important finding indicated that assertive community treatment needs to be offered to patients over the longer term. This led to a change in ethos and a change in name from training in community living to assertive community treatment, reflecting a service providing continuous, longer-term support rather than one-off training.</p></div><div id="sec-3" class="subsection"><h3>Assertive community treatment</h3><p id="p-6">Assertive community treatment has influenced service development internationally (<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-19">Marshall &amp; Lockwood, 1998</a>). This wider influence can be attributed in part to the rigorous manner in which Stein and Test conducted their original study, and in part to successful early replication outside of the USA. One of the most important of these early studies was a replication of training in community living in Sydney, Australia (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-16">Hoult <em>et al</em>, 1984</a>).</p><p id="p-7">The evidence base for assertive community treatment, although showing some attenuation since the early groundbreaking studies, has remained strong in the USA (<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-23">Mueser <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>). The same cannot be said of the UK, where evidence for any advantage over standard community mental health team care has not been forthcoming (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-15">Holloway &amp; Carson, 1998</a>; <a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-4">Burns <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>). One possible exception has been the apparent benefit of assertive community treatment for adults with learning disability (<a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-31">Tyrer <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). The lack of evidence for this treatment approach in the UK was not something we expected when writing in this journal 9 years ago (<a id="xref-ref-18-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-18">Kent &amp; Burns, 1996</a>) and it is something we shall return to later in this article.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>The key elements of assertive community treatment</h2><p id="p-8">The original US model of assertive community treatment has been well described (<a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-28">Test, 1992</a>). A multidisciplinary core services team (continuous treatment team) is responsible for helping its patients meet all of their needs, and does so by being the primary provider of services wherever possible. The team offers continuity of care over time and across traditional service boundaries 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Patients are engaged and followed up assertively, and treatment is offered in the community rather than in traditional service settings. The emphasis is on helping individuals to function as independently as possible, by teaching and enhancing skills in the environment where they will be needed, rather than in day hospitals and sheltered workshops. The patient is assisted in meeting basic needs such as housing, food and work, and the development of a supportive social and family environment. Care plans for each patient are individualised and adaptable to changing needs over time. Goals such as reduced symptom severity, increased community tenure and improved social functioning are explicit. A keyworker from the team is responsible for providing and coordinating the care of each individual, helping the person to manage his or her symptoms on a day-to-day basis and overseeing medication (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><p id="p-9">As we indicated in our previous article (<a id="xref-ref-18-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-18">Kent &amp; Burns, 1996</a>), assertive community treatment is a pure form of clinical case management (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-17">Kanter, 1989</a>) and lies at the opposite end of the case management continuum to the earlier &#x2018;brokerage&#x2019; model (<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-30">Thornicroft, 1991</a>). Many of its underlying concepts have become emblematic of good clinical practice. Individualised, needs-led care planning coordinated by a keyworker is the cornerstone of the care programme approach (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-8">Department of Health, 1990</a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Key elements of the assertive community treatment model</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-22">In the absence of strongly identified &#x2018;critical components&#x2019; of assertive community treatment that distinguish it from other community interventions in the UK, it is probably best to talk of indicators of good practice.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Indicators of good practice</h2><div id="sec-6" class="subsection"><h3>Which patients benefit?</h3><p id="p-23">In order to determine who assertive community treatment is for we need to consider what it is for (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-1">Burns &amp; Firn, 2002</a>) (Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).

 </div><p id="p-37">Accumulated clinical experience suggests that mentally disordered offenders and individuals with a primary diagnosis of personality disorder do not seem to benefit greatly. Although studies of assertive community treatment for forensic populations are ongoing, one study found that intensively managed forensic patients actually spent longer in prison (<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-26">Solomon &amp; Draine, 1995</a>). Rather more unexpectedly, given the target population for assertive community treatment, people with predominantly negative symptoms also seem to gain little. This may well be because of a ceiling effect.</p></div><div id="sec-7" class="subsection"><h3>The case manager</h3><p id="p-38">Collaborative keyworking remains the dominant approach within assertive community treatment teams, with case managers tending to take a lead role with their allocated patients rather than an exclusive role. This means that, although keyworkers tend to function in a generic role that transcends traditional boundaries of professional expertise, patients get to know more than one member of the team. Consequently they should be less vulnerable to critical dependence on any one individual. It makes staff holidays and sickness easier to negotiate. It also allows staff with specialist skills to enter in and out of the care of a patient as the need arises, in a more natural and seamless way. For example, a team member with an occupational therapy background might be asked to see another key-worker&#x2019;s patient to discuss vocational opportunities and remain able to cover for the lead keyworker in respect of his or her broader generic role.</p><p id="p-39">There appears to be significant variation in case-loads between assertive community treatment teams in different parts of the UK; the range in London is between 5 and 14 patients per full-time staff member (<a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-33">Wright <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>). The results of the UK 700 study raise questions about the merit of very low case-loads (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-2">Burns <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). Team leaders need to think carefully about where they set their team&#x2019;s threshold. As a rule of thumb there must be capacity for patients to be seen once or twice a week on a routine basis, with less frequent visiting being the exception. Importantly, teams need to retain the capacity to work very intensively with individuals when the need arises, for example, to avoid hospital admission. A well-functioning assertive community treatment team should be able to visit patients with high needs for care on a daily basis and sustain this level of involvement for several weeks (<a id="xref-ref-1-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-1">Burns &amp; Firn, 2002</a>). From a purely practical perspective, case-loads greater than 15 are unlikely to allow this.</p></div><div id="sec-8" class="subsection"><h3>The team</h3><p id="p-40">Traditional assertive community treatment teams emphasise a team approach to case management, with all members getting to know all patients and pooling responsibility for their care. The aim is to avoid an &#x2018;overinvolved&#x2019; one-to-one relationship that might lead to pathological dependency.</p><p id="p-41">Advantages to a team approach include the dilution of stress by sharing anxiety during crises and the prevention of the emotional burnout associated with close one-to-one work with resentful or treatment-resistant individuals. In practice, teams manage large numbers of patients and members cannot be expected to know every single one well enough to step into the case management role, with adequate knowledge of relapse signatures, risk indicators and social networks. Engaging individuals in treatment is also more difficult if they have to deal with many staff rather than a few. Teams usually need to adopt a pragmatic approach, using the blend of team- and keyworking that best suits each individual patient. For example, some individuals successfully engage with only one or two members, whereas others get to know all of the team over time.</p><div id="sec-9" class="subsection"><h4>Skills mix</h4><p id="p-42">Assertive community treatment teams need to maintain the same broad mix of skills as traditional community mental health teams. Arguably the range of skills is even more important, as one of the guiding principles of assertive community treatment is that the team should provide as much direct care as possible and avoid referring externally. The importance of this is illustrated by the frequent need to work with individuals with dual diagnosis. For this reason, teams really benefit if they have someone skilled in the assessment and management of substance misuse.</p><p id="p-43">Gaps in a team&#x2019;s skills mix can be addressed with training. Skills in cognitive&#x2013;behavioural therapy, compliance counselling and motivational interviewing, for example, can be acquired by all mental health professionals. Indeed, the value of these therapies in engaging and treating people with enduring psychotic illnesses, together with their emphasis on a collaborative and non-confrontational approach, make them important skills for all clinical case managers in assertive community treatment teams.</p><p id="p-44">Assertive community treatment requires staff not only to develop new skills, but also to adopt new ways of working. It demands a lot of individual case managers, whatever their professional background, as they are continuously expected to work beyond traditional professional boundaries and develop at least a minimal competence across a range of areas. These competencies include stabilising the patient&#x2019;s living situation, monitoring medication and ensuring adherence, crisis resolution, and training and supporting the individual in activities of daily living in their own environment (<a id="xref-ref-1-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-1">Burns &amp; Firn, 2002</a>). When the team contains a good mix of different professionals, there is much to be said for regular interprofessional training. This approach is not only cost-effective, but it also promotes team-building and helps highlight gaps in a team&#x2019;s skills mix. Where there are gaps, training from external agencies can be sought.</p><p id="p-45">As with all mental health teams, a real value of a diverse mix of professionals working closely together is the breadth and depth of expertise that can be brought to bear on a problem. The different perspectives and philosophies that come with a social work or nursing background, for example, can add enormously to discussions about patient management.</p><p id="p-46">In the future, non-professionally qualified support workers may have a more prominent role within UK assertive community treatment teams. Indeed, there may be real advantages in employing &#x2018;fresh&#x2019; staff unconstrained by any one professional tradition. Experience suggests that they can be very effective at engaging patients, especially when they themselves have had experience of mental health problems. &#x2018;User-workers&#x2019; are particularly common in US teams.</p><p id="p-47">Key areas of expertise that should be available within an assertive community treatment team are summarised in Box 3<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-3"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 3</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Key areas of expertise</strong></h3>

Transferring patients back to routine services should happen in a planned way, after a long period of reduction in clinical input from the assertive community treatment team to test stability and allow an adequate handover period. If the transition to the standard service fails there should be flexibility within the system for the individual to be referred back to the assertive community treatment team.</p><p id="p-76">A small minority of patients fail to engage with any team. There are no hard and fast rules about how long an assertive community treatment team should attempt to engage such individuals, but sometimes the team has to accept that it will not succeed. By the same token, the lack of proven success for assertive community treatment with individuals who have predominantly negative symptoms means that the team needs to carefully weigh the possibility of small to insignificant gains against a large amount of time and clinical effort. Discharging patients who have consistently failed to benefit will allow a degree of &#x2018;throughput&#x2019; &#x2013; freeing places for individuals who may experience much greater gains.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-18"><h2>Current status of assertive community treatment in the UK</h2><p id="p-77">As indicated, early optimism about the benefits of assertive community treatment in the UK has not been matched by reality. The studies that have been conducted have failed to demonstrate the hoped for improvements in long-term outcome, with reduced bed occupancy a primary measure (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-12">Ford <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>; <a id="xref-ref-15-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-15">Holloway &amp; Carson, 1998</a>; <a id="xref-ref-35-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-35">Wykes <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>; <a id="xref-ref-2-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-2">Burns <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). There has been no convincing evidence that assertive community treatment is better than pre-existing UK community mental health services at improving clinical symptoms, social functioning or quality of life. The lack of any impact on bed occupancy has meant that there has been no demonstrable economic benefit either (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-5">Byford <em>et al</em>, 2000</a>). Given the comparable performance of the less expensive community mental health teams in UK studies, there are inevitable issues regarding the introduction of assertive community treatment services nationwide. The cautions voiced about the costs and benefits of assertive community treatment in the commentary accompanying our first article seem even wiser with hindsight (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/388#ref-14">Hirsch, 1996</a>).</p><p id="p-78">The key challenges, then, are to seek to understand the UK results in a way that helps us improve our services across the board and to manage assertive community treatment teams in their local context in a creative way that ensures delivery of the very best for their patients.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-24"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-86">Assertive community treatment is the most widespread and durable model of clinical case management for the treatment and rehabilitation of people with severe and enduring mental health problems. It is established in the USA, where it has been repeatedly shown to have significant advantages over routine care, and it is increasingly being adopted in the UK and mainland Europe. Although the same advantages have not been demonstrated outside of the USA, allocation of new funding to assertive community treatment in the UK has effectively ring-fenced resources for the care of some of the patients with the greatest needs.</p><p id="p-87">Assertive community treatment should be an addition to well-organised and appropriately resourced routine services; it should not be a replacement. It should be restricted to individuals with psychosis and complex needs, utilising evidence-based interventions wherever possible and applying indicators of good practice to local circumstances. Research continues into what the effective elements of assertive community treatment are and into how to target the most appropriate patients to benefit from this form of care.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-25"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-6"><li id="list-item-31">

id="abstract-1"><h2>Abstract</h2>
 <p id="p-1">Simple schizophrenia is a sometimes controversial diagnosis. Here we review the concept with particular reference to its history in diagnostic systems. Using an illustrative real case of a 25-year-old man, we show that there is a need to retain this diagnostic category, which may fit better within proposed dimensional (psychomotor poverty, disorganisation and reality distortion) rather than categorical classifications of schizophrenia. Symptoms of the disorder may be better revealed by functional assessment than by relying on descriptive psychopathology.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Vignette: Mr B</p><p id="p-3">Mr B is a 25-year-old man, referred to a national neuropsychiatry assessment service by his community mental health team. The referral was at the request of his parents, who wondered if he might have Asperger syndrome.</p><p id="p-4">Mr B was born by normal vaginal delivery at term and his parents described normal motor, language and social communication milestones. He grew up with both parents and three brothers. Throughout primary and secondary mainstream school he made friends easily and excelled at sport to the extent that at age 11 he gained a black belt in karate. Mr B left school after achieving an average performance in state examinations, on a par with his brothers&#x2019; achievements. School reports are positive and describe no behavioural or academic problems.</p><p id="p-5">However, at age 15 Mr B began to be more isolated, losing contact with school friends and interacting minimally with his family, eating in his bedroom alone and maintaining poor personal hygiene.</p><p id="p-6">Over the next 10 years Mr B had little contact outside the family home. He attempted several jobs, including labouring and factory work, but despite an initial good impression was asked to leave each position, often after a very short period. Reasons included an inability to conform to safety regulations, lateness and chaotic behaviour. At the time of admission he had not worked at all during the previous year.</p><p id="p-7">Mr B revealed increasing difficulties in planning and making decisions. An example given by his parents was an occasion when he attempted to cut a piece of wood with an electric saw while balancing the wood over banisters. His parents became so concerned both by the dangerousness of this and his aggressive response when they asked him to stop that they called the police. Mr B was reported as being increasingly irritable. If his parents thwarted his actions, episodes of verbal aggression were precipitated.</p><p id="p-8">The deterioration in overall functioning, social behaviour and planning ability was gradual and Mr B&#x2019;s parents sought help after 10 years only because of his low threshold for verbal aggression and his inability to hold down a job. For many years his social withdrawal was attributed by the family to self-consciousness related to his facial acne.</p><p id="p-9">There was no family history of psychiatric disorder, no medical history and up to admission Mr B had lived with his parents.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Psychiatric history</h2><p id="p-10">Mr B&#x2019;s first psychiatric assessment was by his local community mental health team (CMHT). It was thought that his symptoms might reflect dysmorphophobia, although particular somatic preoccupations were not elicited. He was prescribed paroxetine, which did not alter his mental state. Five months later, Mr B was referred to the neuropsychiatry service for a second opinion.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Mental state examination</h2><p id="p-11">Examination revealed a young White man, slightly unkempt, able to maintain good eye contact and rapport, but who appeared perplexed. Mr B struggled to describe his experience of feeling different from other people and his sense of confusion and muddled thoughts. It was sometimes difficult to follow his train of thought and he used stock phrases such as &#x2018;I just want to get on with life&#x2019;. He reported low mood attributed to his sense that his life was going badly. He did not experience suicidal thoughts, sleep and appetite were unchanged, and objectively Mr B was euthymic. There was no evidence of hallucinations or delusions. He was not apathetic and was felt to have a warm and reactive affect.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Physical examination</h2><p id="p-12">This was unremarkable, with no evidence of focal neurological signs, movement disorder or soft neurological signs. Investigations included routine blood tests, which were within normal ranges, an electroencephalogram, which was normal, and magentic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, which revealed a 13 mm pineal cyst.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>Cognitive functioning</h2><p id="p-13">A neuropsychological assessment indicated that his current general intellectual functioning fell at the bottom of the average range (full-scale IQ = 90) as measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale &#x2013; Third Edition (WAIS&#x2013;III; <a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-22">Wechsler, 1997</a>). This represents a decline from premorbid levels, estimated using the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR; <a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-23">Wechsler, 2001</a>) to fall in the middle of the average range (full-scale IQ = 102). This discrepancy is statistically significant although relatively frequent, occurring in 10&#x2013;24% of the normal population (<a id="xref-ref-23-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-23">Wechsler, 2001</a>).</p><p id="p-14">Mr B exhibited significant memory impairments. His working memory index (WMI) score from the WAIS&#x2013;III (WMI = 80) had declined from estimated premorbid levels. Assessment with the Adult Memory and Information Processing Battery (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-6">Coughlan &amp; Hollows, 1995</a>) revealed verbal memory deficits in both learning and recall, although his visual memory was unimpaired.</p><p id="p-15">Tests evaluating Mr B&#x2019;s language functioning included the Vocabulary and Similarities sub-tests of the WAIS&#x2013;III, the WTAR and Thurstone&#x2019;s Word Fluency Test (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-15">Lezak, 1995</a>). His vocabulary and reading abilities remained in keeping with levels predicted by his demographic background. In contrast, he showed deterioration in verbal abstract reasoning, as indicated by a poor score on the Similarities sub-test. He also had difficulties on Thurstone&#x2019;s Word Fluency task, where his performance fell below the 10th percentile, indicating a deficit in spontaneous word generation.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Executive functioning</h2><p id="p-16">Mr B&#x2019;s executive functioning was assessed with Thurstone&#x2019;s Word Fluency Test, the Behavioural Assessment of Dysexecutive Syndrome (<a id="xref-ref-24-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-24">Wilson <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>) and the Hayling and Brixton Tests (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-5">Burgess &amp; Shallice, 1997</a>). Mr B performance was impaired on most tests, indicating deficits in verbal fluency, strategy formation, planning, organisation, response inhibition and rule learning. Further evidence consistent with executive dysfunction included behavioural disinhibition during testing, including telling a dirty joke and being unaware that it was inappropriate, and being undressed when testing was to be resumed after a break.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-6"><h2>Occupational therapy assessment</h2><p id="p-17">An occupational therapy assessment was undertaken using the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-8">Fisher, 2003</a>). This is an observational assessment enabling simultaneous evaluation of motor and process skills and their effect on a person&#x2019;s ability to perform domestic or personal daily living skills required for community living. The results are analysed to provide profiles of performance and measures of motor and process skills.</p><p id="p-18">Given a range of options, Mr B chose to be assessed on making a fresh fruit salad and beans on toast (harder than average tasks). His motor skills were satisfactory and were deemed to not limit his safety, although he had some stability problems in moving around the kitchen and he dropped some objects when using both hands. In contrast his process skills were well below the cut-off for satisfactory performance. He demonstrated consistent problems with temporal organisation and difficulties in initiating steps and frequently started a new task before completing the previous one. He left steps out, repeated steps or put them in the wrong order, such as buttering the bread before putting it in the toaster. However, despite his difficulties, he was motivated to participate in the assessment and was enthusiastic about becoming more independent.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-7"><h2>Diagnosis, treatment and outcome</h2><p id="p-19">Mr B&#x2019;s clinical picture was therefore characterised by progressive though insidious development of odd behaviour, difficulties meeting the demands of society and decline in overall performance. In the absence of hallucinations and delusions over a 10-year period, this is consistent with a diagnosis of simple schizophrenia as defined in ICD&#x2013;10 (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-27">World Health Organization, 1992</a>). We prescribed olanzapine. This was discontinued after 1 month because of intolerable side-effects of weight gain and drowsiness. Risperidone was initiated with few side-effects, and Mr B reported an improvement in the subjective clarity of his thoughts. His parents reported satisfaction that their son appeared calmer and less impulsive during a period of leave in the family home. Mr B was discharged home and to the care of the local CMHT with a plan to attend a local resource centre daily, with regular community psychiatric nurse and psychiatrist contact.</p><p id="p-20">A year later, Mr B remained engaged with his local CMHT and had just begun a semi-residential occupational and social rehabilitation programme. He continued to be disorganised, but showed less impulsivity and was generally calm. He remained on risperidone.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-8"><h2>Discussion</h2><p id="p-21">Mr B&#x2019;s case illustrates the presentation of simple schizophrenia characterised by a gradual insidious deterioration, leading, in this case, to a 10-year delay in diagnosis and treatment. Interestingly, the extent of Mr B&#x2019;s difficulties was less readily revealed by the descriptive psychopathological assessment and more obviously determined by the neuropsychology and occupational therapy functional assessments.</p><p id="p-22">A diagnosis of simple schizophrenia can only be made after other causes of deterioration have been excluded, specifically the cognitive impairment of early-onset dementia, learning disability (ICD&#x2013;10 mental retardation) or a pervasive developmental disorder, which could present with similar difficulties. Mr B&#x2019;s clearly documented good premorbid level of functioning both academically and socially excluded a pervasive developmental disorder such as Asperger syndrome or learning disability. The absence of an aetiological medical condition and the absence of findings on MRI made the diagnosis of dementia in a young person extremely unlikely.</p><div id="sec-9" class="subsection"><h3>Simple schizophrenia: history of the concept</h3><p id="p-23">Simple schizophrenia (dementia simplex) was first described by Otto Diem in 1903 as a subgroup of Emil Kraepelin&#x2019;s dementia praecox:</p><p id="p-24">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">&#x2018;In addition to the clinical pictures . . . which terminate in . . . dementia praecox, . . . [there is] a further type leading to the same terminal state, . . . but [for which] the onset is simple, indolent without special prodrome, without acute episodes, without illusions or hallucinations, . . .&#x2019; <em>(</em>quoted in <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli , 1989</a><em>).</em></q>
 </p><p id="p-26">This syndrome was elaborated by Eugen Bleuler in 1908. He viewed simple schizophrenia as a syndrome characterised by the core features of schizophrenia: autism, loosening of associations, ambivalence and affective disturbance but lacking the accessory symptoms of hallucinations and delusions. Bleuler commented that this picture was seen more commonly outside institutions, for example in labourers, vagrants and peddlers (Bleuler, 1911, cited in <a id="xref-ref-3-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli, 1989</a>).</p><p id="p-27">In 1913 the diagnostic category was further recognised when Kraepelin himself added simple schizophrenia as a subtype of schizophrenia in the eighth edition of his textbook of psychiatry (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-14">Kraepelin, 1919</a>). Diem, Bleuler and Kraepelin all agreed that simple schizophrenia was characterised by a change in personality, a loss of interests and an overall loss of functional ability. This state progressed to a clinical picture shared with the other subtypes of schizophrenia of avolition, amotivation and inactivity. The diagnosis received widespread acceptance, as evidenced by its inclusion in standard textbooks and psychiatric literature, and in 1948 it was added to the sixth edition of what has become the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (<a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-25">World Health Organization, 1948</a>). In 1952 it made it into the first edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (now known as DSM&#x2013;I) (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-1">American Psychiatric Association, 1952</a>). Simple schizophrenia is described in the current ICD&#x2013;10 in the following terms:</p><p id="p-28">
 <q id="disp-quote-2">&#x2018;an insidious but progressive development of oddities of conduct, inability to meet the demands of society, and decline in total performance. Delusions and hallucinations are not evident . . . &#x201C;negative&#x201D; features of residual schizophrenia . . . develop without being preceded by any overt psychotic symptoms. . . . the individual may [appear] self-absorbed, idle, and aimless&#x2019; (<a id="xref-ref-27-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-27">World Health Organization, 1992</a>: p. 95).</q>
 </p><p id="p-30">Although accepted in internationally agreed diagnostic systems, the diagnosis remained controversial. Reviewing the description in seven textbooks published between 1919 and 1978, <a id="xref-ref-3-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli (1989)</a> pointed out that a lack of drive and a deteriorating course are the only consistent diagnostic features. In particular there is a lack of agreement on the presence or absence of thought disorder as a diagnostic feature.</p><p id="p-31">In an influential paper <a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-21">Stone <em>et al</em>(1968)</a> trenchantly criticised the whole concept of simple schizophrenia on a number of grounds. First, in almost 40 years only one significant clinical paper, that by Kant in 1948, had been published on simple schizophrenia; second, the diagnosis (based on state hospital figures) was rarely used in practice; third, the diagnostic criteria were vague; and fourth, there was lack of agreement on the presence or absence of thought disorder. A decade later, the International Pilot Study of Schizophrenia (<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-26">World Health Organization, 1979</a>) failed to support the diagnostic utility of any of the sub-syndromes of schizophrenia, including the simple schizophrenia subtype.</p><p id="p-32">Thus, the concept of simple schizophrenia disappeared in the third revision of the DSM and, although it remains within the ICD, ICD&#x2013;10 advises that it be used with caution as a diagnosis of uncertain nosological validity.</p><p id="p-33">Black &amp; Boffeli revisited the controversy in 1989 (<a id="xref-ref-3-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli, 1989</a>). They acknowledged the problems of heterogeneity but argued that the concept remained of heuristic value and was not covered by any of the existing categories in DSM&#x2013;III. In a further paper (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-4">Black &amp; Boffeli, 1990</a>) they reviewed the notes of 52 people diagnosed with simple schizophrenia between 1939 and 1964, reassigning diagnoses where they felt it necessary. Applying DSM&#x2013;III criteria they found that these individuals were largely young, unemployed and living with their parents, but there was a great deal of heterogeneity with respect to diagnosis. The most common reassigned diagnosis was that of affective disorders. This was in obvious contrast to much of the literature, which emphasised the links between simple schizophrenia and other schizophrenic syndromes. They concluded, however, that the exclusion of simple schizophrenia from DSM&#x2013;III had led to a diagnostic gap, with individuals who experienced loss of motivation and a progressively deteriorating course not falling within the boundaries of the diagnosis of a personality disorder but excluded from the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Arising from this they proposed an operational definition of simple schizophrenia, which they renamed &#x2018;simple deteriorative state&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-34">The DSM&#x2013;IV (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-2">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</a>) includes simple schizophrenia again as &#x2018;criteria set for further study&#x2019; and names it simple deteriorative disorder, in line with the suggestion of <a id="xref-ref-3-5" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli (1989)</a>. However, the criteria in DSM&#x2013;IV differ from those proposed by Black &amp; Boffeli in at least one important particular. Although Black &amp; Boffeli emphasised the importance of functional decline, they suggested the inclusion of criteria relating to vague speech, odd beliefs and peculiar behaviours. The DSM does not include disorganised speech and behaviour.</p></div><div id="sec-10" class="subsection"><h3>Studies of simple schizophrenia</h3><p id="p-35">Perhaps understandably in view of its uncertain diagnostic validity, relatively few studies have focused on people with this diagnosis. <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-7">Dworkin (1992)</a> compared individuals fulfilling Bleuler&#x2019;s criteria for simple schizophrenia with individuals with typical schizophrenia. He re-examined the case histories of 151 monozygotic twin pairs with respect to negative symptoms, premorbid social adjustment and age at onset. He found that 220 individuals had a diagnosis of schizophrenia, 18 of whom met criteria for simple schizophrenia. Of these, 14 were co-twins. Dworkin concluded that individuals in the sample without hallucinations or delusions and those with typical schizophrenia were more similar than different. The main difference he did find was that fewer cases meeting the criteria for simple schizophrenia recorded a particular age at onset. This is consistent with the insidious onset described by Bleuler. Although not specifically commented on by Dworkin, it is interesting that such a high proportion of those with simple schizophrenia were co-twins, as this suggests that individuals with this disorder are less likely to be primarily identified as having schizophrenia and that it may represent a phenotype of schizophrenia in which the genetic contribution is particularly marked.</p><p id="p-36">The importance of the genetic contribution to the simple schizophrenia subtype was further explored in two papers from the Roscommon Family Study. The first (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-12">Kendler <em>et al</em>, 1994</a>) suggested that simple schizophrenia is relatively rare (they estimated a population prevalence of 5.3 per 10 000), debilitating and similar to typical schizophrenia in terms of presentation and course, the major difference being the presence or absence of psychotic symptoms. There was a higher than expected incidence of schizophrenia in relatives. In the second study, <a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-13">Kirkpatrick <em>et al</em>(2000)</a> found the rate of schizophrenia in the families of individuals with a deficit syndrome (simple schizophrenia) to be similar to that for relatives of those with non-deficit-type schizophrenia, again suggesting a continuum between simple schizophrenia and the typical schizophrenia subtypes.</p><p id="p-37">The criteria proposed by <a id="xref-ref-3-6" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-3">Black &amp; Boffeli (1989)</a> were applied by <a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-20">Serra-Mestres <em>et al</em>(2000)</a> to identify a sample of nine patients with simple schizophrenia. Psychometry and functional neuroimaging of this group revealed deficits consistent with the pattern seen in typical schizophrenia, including general intellectual impairment with deficits in memory and executive functioning. Most computed tomography scans were normal but a high rate of abnormality was found on single photon emission tomography.</p><p id="p-38"><a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-9">Galderisi <em>et al</em>(1999)</a> compared neuromorphological abnormalities revealed on MRI scans in individuals with simple schizophrenia, typical schizophrenia and controls. They concluded that both simple schizophrenia and typical schizophrenia show significantly more abnormalities than the control condition, specifically greater brain development abnormalities and greater ventricular and subarachnoid space volumes.</p><p id="p-39">There has been very little discussion in the literature regarding treatment of simple schizophrenia. In our experience, Mr B responded moderately well to treatment with risperidone, showing both objective and subjective improvements. This is echoed by a handful of case reports recording successful use of atypical antipsychotics in treating this patient group (<a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-10">Hirose, 2000</a>; <a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-18">Rollnik <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>; <a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-19">Sekine <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>).</p></div><div id="sec-11" class="subsection"><h3>A dimensional approach</h3><p id="p-40">We have illustrated the diagnostic complexities of simple schizophrenia with the case of a young man with normal premorbid development who has developed a deteriorating disorder in the absence of positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Within current classification systems, simple schizophrenia would seem to be the most apposite diagnosis. The problems and controversies associated with this diagnosis, however, remain. It has been argued that newer nosological systems for schizophrenia should be on a dimensional rather than categorical basis.</p><p id="p-41"><a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-16">Liddle (1987)</a>, for example, proposed the three dimensions of psychomotor poverty, disorganisation and reality distortion as a more useful sub-syndrome division of chronic schizophrenia than the traditional positive&#x2013;negative dichotomy. This proposal grew out of factor analysis of symptoms in patients with chronic illness but has proved influential and has been supported by neuroimaging findings (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/398#ref-17">Liddle, 1996</a>). Simple schizophrenia would be characterised as a relatively pure form of the psychomotor poverty syndrome because of the importance attached to negative symptoms.</p><p id="p-42">However, we have described how successive classification systems have been unclear about the diagnostic importance of thought disorder. This may in part reflect the difficulty sometimes of characterising or quantifying disorganisation of thoughts using the language of descriptive psychopathology. The problems revealed by the more function-based assessments of neuropsychology and the assessment of living skills are more striking and persuasive. We would argue that Liddle&#x2019;s dimensional characterisation of schizophrenia would contribute towards preventing patients such as Mr B falling between diagnostic stools, representing as he does a relatively pure form not of psychomotor poverty but of disorganisation.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-12"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-43">There exists a group of patients who present to psychiatrists with a pattern of insidious cognitive decline in the absence of florid positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Cognitive symptoms, including disorders of thought, may be overlooked owing to overreliance on the symptoms and signs of descriptive psychopathology. Functional assessments using psychological batteries and occupational therapy assessments may be more revealing. The dimensional classification of schizophrenia may help us identify and diagnose this group of patients by highlighting domains of social decline and cognitive disorganisation. Their illness is distinct from developmental disorders such as Asperger syndrome and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. As early treatment may be important, psychiatrists should be prepared to consider the diagnosis of simple schizophrenia, and psychiatric nosologies must allow for a category of relatively pure disorganisation, either by including disorganisation in the criteria for simple schizophrenia or by adopting a more dimensional approach to classification.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-13"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-1"><li id="list-item-1">

 <p id="p-1">We review key recent research and guidance for staff working with acutely disturbed psychiatric patients. Assessment of aggressive patients and their situation should enable full risk assessment, which may ideally involve the use of advance directives. We discuss appropriate use of the Mental Health Act 1983 and consider benefits and adverse effects of rapid tranquillisation. We present a simple protocol for oral or intramuscular rapid tranquillisation. Staff using physical restraint should be properly trained and consider sensitively issues of the patient&#x2019;s diginity, gender and the most appropriate location for restraint to occur. Simple precautions can improve safety when working with potentially disturbed patients. Staff need support during and after the management of an aggressive incident.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">The treatment of acutely disturbed patients is a difficult, inherently stressful, but ubiquitous requirement of psychiatric practice. When we developed our first guidelines as a multidisciplinary collaboration almost 10 years ago (<a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-36">Macpherson <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>), it appeared to us that a lack of consensus among senior psychiatrists on appropriate treatment contributed to uncertainty about treatment in this area. Treatments of dubious rationale were often being used, without a clear evidence base. Our original guidelines aimed to set out principles covering general aspects of management, including drug treatment.</p><p id="p-3">There has subsequently been increasing scrutiny of practice in this area. The <a id="xref-ref-39-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-39">National Audit Office (2003)</a> noted a 40% increase between 1999 and 2002 in self-reported violence experienced by National Health Service (NHS) staff, rates of violence being 2.5 times higher in mental health and learning disability trusts than in other NHS trusts. Under-reporting was considered widespread, and it was estimated that violent incidents cost the NHS &#xA3;69 million a year (this figure took no account of the &#x2018;human&#x2019; costs). The Audit Office report found substantial variation in training in both risk assessment and management of violence, and serious deficits in training among doctors in particular. There was marked inconsistency in staff support following violence, and successful prosecution by assaulted staff was rare. The inquiry into the death of David Bennett (<a id="xref-ref-42-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-42">Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire Strategic Health Authority, 2003</a>), who collapsed and died following prolonged restraint in psychiatric care, raised important concerns about cultural awareness and sensitivity of staff.</p><p id="p-4">In response the UK Government (<a id="xref-ref-19-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-19">Department of Health, 2005</a>) accepted recommendations for mandatory training in cultural awareness and sensitivity of all mental health staff, for the development of a national system of training in restraint and control and that all medical staff and registered nurses working in mental health should have up-to-date resuscitation training. The failure to accept a recommendation restricting prone restraint to a 3-min time limit has been controversial, although <a id="xref-ref-43-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-43">Paterson &amp; Leadbetter (2004)</a> have pointed out that any time limit for such a complex, difficult procedure is arbitrary and probably reflects an awareness (among the authors of the Government&#x2019;s response) of the harsh realities of restraining patients, a process &#x2018;usually entered into by staff only with considerable reluctance and sometimes real fear&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-5">Overall, there is little to suggest that the NHS&#x2019;s &#x2018;zero tolerance&#x2019; campaign (<a id="xref-ref-40-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-40">National Health Service, 1999</a>) has had a major impact in reducing the problem of assaults on mental health or other NHS staff. However, there appear to have been some significant developments in clinical practice and understanding in this field. The increasing availability of specialist care provided through the model of the psychiatric intensive care unit (PICU) has facilitated a concentration of skills and expertise, and this has been associated with a developing evidence base in the field of rapid tranquillisation. Policies for rapid tranquillisation and emergency treatment operate in most if not all psychiatric hospitals. National Health Service trusts aim to provide in-patient staff with training in control and restraint, de-escalation and breakaway techniques, to deal more effectively with situations involving violence or aggression. The development of formal guidelines, first by the <a id="xref-ref-47-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-47">Royal College of Psychiatrists (1998)</a> and then initially in a draft consultation document and subsequently in clinical guidelines by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (<a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-41">NICE; 2005</a>), has helped to clarify and disseminate best practice.</p><p id="p-6">As a result of many positive developments in this area, our task in writing the present article has changed significantly from that in 1996. While our first work was an attempt to produce guidelines based on experience and research evidence, here we draw on a wide range of evidence sources, including published evidence-based guidelines. A number of key reports and guidelines are now available to assist mental health and other professionals who deal with acutely disturbed psychiatric patients in various settings. The most useful of these are listed in Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>. We have tried to produce simple, user-friendly guidance distilled from these and other sources and relating to practice in standard healthcare settings.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Important recent guidelines</strong></h3>

 </div><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Background</h2><p id="p-14">Treating acutely disturbed patients can be dangerous for both patients and staff. The most serious patient risk is of sudden cardiorespiratory collapse, which has been associated with the use of antipsychotics particularly during physical arousal (<a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-33">Lader, 1992</a>). <a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-4">Banerjee <em>et al</em>(1995)</a> examined the deaths of 206 detained patients, identifying 15 as &#x2018;iatrogenic&#x2019;. Concerns were raised about the use of high-dose medication and polypharmacy by inexperienced nurses and trainee psychiatrists who are not directly supervised by seniors.</p><p id="p-15">An interesting paper by <a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-31">Hyde <em>et al</em>(1998)</a>, describing practice in a psychiatric intensive care unit, found that patient dissatisfaction and non-understandable provocation were related to violent incidents, suggesting that environmental factors, education and remedial action may reduce risks of violence.</p><p id="p-16"><a id="xref-ref-49-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-49">Simpson &amp; Anderson (1996)</a> raised concerns about the lack of adequate resuscitation facilities, training and guidelines in acute psychiatric units. It will be interesting to see whether the publication of the NICE and other guidelines (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>) results in a more consistent, evidence-based approach to treatment in standard clinical settings.</p><p id="p-17">A recent review of treatment approaches (<a id="xref-ref-16-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-16">DeFruyt &amp; Demyttenaere, 2004</a>) identified a number of limitations in research in this area, including unclear definitions of agitation and of therapeutic goals, small sample size and a lack of the patients&#x2019; perspective. Research findings have been inconsistent and the implications for practice not always clear. Inevitably, there are practical problems in studying this complex, ethically fraught area of clinical practice. Recent guidelines regulate the use of restraint more than at any previous time (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-3">Appelbaum, 1999</a>; <a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-18">Department of Health, 2004</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Assessment of disturbed patients</h2></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Risk assessment</h2><p id="p-30">Risk assessment should take account of historical factors known to be associated with increased risk of violence, the strongest of which being history of previous violence. This should be combined with a view of the individual and his or her circumstances, leading to a clinical judgement informed by the fact that risk changes with personal, illness and treatment factors. In predicting risk of violence, empirically proven risk assessment instruments such as the Historical, Clinical and Risk Assessment Manual (HCR&#x2013;20; <a id="xref-ref-52-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-52">Webster <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>) are effective and reliable as an additional aid to clinical judgement (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-5">Belfrage, 1998</a>). Instruments of this type should also be used to inform the development of local risk assessment policy.</p><p id="p-31">Training in risk management is mandatory for most staff in NHS trusts, although the quality and evidence base used for much of this training has been questioned (<a id="xref-ref-34-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-34">Leadbetter &amp; Perkins, 2002</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-6"><h2>Advance directives</h2><p id="p-32">Ideally, patients who have been identified as at risk of disturbed or violent behaviour should be given the opportunity to have their treatment needs and wishes recorded in the form of an advance directive. This should fit within the context of their overall care and should clearly state what interventions they would and would not wish to receive in the event of acute relapse. This documentation should be reviewed periodically. In practice, it is evident that the system of advance directives is as yet poorly developed and lengthy work is needed involving patients, families, clinicians and hospital management (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-2">Amering <em>et al</em>, 2005</a>). Time will tell whether the intensive training and substantial administrative commitment required to support this process is forthcoming.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-7"><h2>Mental Health Act status</h2><p id="p-33">Staff who deal with emergency psychiatric treatment need regular training on the relevant legal issues, including Mental Health Act 1983 legislation and the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights 1950. Comprehensive, detailed recording of all aspects of treatment is essential.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-10"><h2>Rapid tranquillisation</h2><p id="p-36">Rapid tranquillisation is the administration of medication to calm or sedate an agitated, aggressive patient. The aim is to reduce patient suffering, allow improved communication, reduce risks to the patient and others, and to do no harm. It is used only when less coercive approaches such as diversion and verbal de-escalation have failed. Antipsychotics are often used in rapid tranquillisation, and can bring about rapid improvement in symptoms of psychosis and mania, to a greater extent than benzodiazepines (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-1">Agid <em>et al</em>, 2003</a>). However, the antipsychotic side-effect akathisia has been associated with suicidality and physical assault (<a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-13">Crowner <em>et al</em>, 1990</a>), and the presence of this and other extrapyramidal side-effects means that the important role of antipsychotics in behaviour control has to be balanced carefully against risks of side-effects. Ideally, they should be used at the minimum dose sufficient to achieve therapeutic benefits.</p><p id="p-37">Rapid tranquillisation and physical interventions such as restraint and seclusion are management strategies, not primary treatment techniques. They should be considered only if de-escalation and other strategies summarised below fail. The clinical need, the safety of the patient and others and, where possible, advance directives should be taken into account when deciding appropriate interventions. The intervention must be a reasonable and proportionate response to the risk posed by the patient. Rapid tranquillisation can be used to avoid prolonged physical intervention.</p><p id="p-38">It is clear that rapid tranquillisation is required in a number of healthcare settings as a regular and routine part of clinical practice. A survey in a London hospital (<a id="xref-ref-45-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-45">Pilowsky <em>et al</em>, 1992</a>) found that 8 different drugs were used in 102 episodes of emergency treatment over 160 days.</p><p id="p-39">There is no national or international consensus on the most effective drug treatment. The drugs most frequently used in the UK are antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, separately or together. <a id="xref-ref-37-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-37">Mannion <em>et al</em>(1997)</a> found that combined regimes were most common, and in 39% of cases a high-dose anti-psychotic was given. Recent systematic reviews of the effectiveness of antipsychotics in treating acute psychosis (e.g. <a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-9">Carpenter <em>et al</em>, 2004</a>; <a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-14">Cure <em>et al</em>, 2004</a>) have concluded that no individual antipsychotic drug has demonstrated greater efficacy or superiority over &#x2018;standard treatment&#x2019;. Further work to assess the efficacy of benzodiazepines (<a id="xref-ref-27-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-27">Gillies <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>) and olanzapine (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-6">Belgamwar <em>et al</em>, 2004</a>) is underway. A review of zuclopenthixol acetate (<a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-26">Fenton <em>et al</em>, 2001</a>) found no specific benefits, other than the possibility reported in just one study that it may produce earlier and more intense sedation than oral haloperidol.</p><p id="p-40">Published reviews have often called for the use of well-conducted randomised controlled trials to properly assess drug differences in this area. In the absence of clear evidence, clinical decisions must be made on the basis of clinical experience, and our knowledge of the relative propensity of different drugs for causing adverse effects (Table 1<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#T2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="table pos-float" id="T2"><div class="table-inline"></div><div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label"><strong>Table 1</strong> </span> <p id="p-146" class="first-child"><strong>Routes of administration and the main side-effects of drugs commonly used in rapid tranquillisation</strong></p></div></div><p id="p-41">Interestingly, it is possible that there is greater consistency of treatment in other countries. A survey from the USA (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-7">Binder &amp; McNeil, 1999</a>) found a preference for haloperidol and lorazepam in combination for rapid tranquillisation. A survey of emergency room practice in Rio de Janeiro (<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-30">Huf <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>) found that a haloperidol&#x2013;promethazine mixture was used for 80% of cases. Promethazine is an antihistamine that has a slow onset of action, but is often an effective sedative. It is rarely used in the UK for rapid tranquillisation, but may have a place as an alternative to benzodiazepines in benzodiazepine-intolerant patients. It should be noted that promethazine is not licensed for use in rapid tranquillisation and caution is advised regarding dosage and safety.</p><p id="p-42">Management of aggression by non-chemical forms of restraint also varies internationally. It is restricted to immediate physical containment and seclusion in standard UK practice, but mechanical restraint is in common usage in many countries, including the USA and former communist countries.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-11"><h2>Adverse effects associated with rapid tranquillisation</h2><p id="p-43">If possible, the patient&#x2019;s drug history must be reviewed to identify the drug of choice and any contraindications. If this is not available, consider the following issues carefully in planning immediate management strategies.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-17"><h2>Rapid tranquillisation of elderly, debilitated or learning-disabled patients</h2><p id="p-49">Reduce recommended doses by 50%. Drugs of choice for elderly people are lorazepam, starting with 0.5&#x2013;1 mg orally; or haloperidol, starting with 0.5&#x2013;1 mg orally or intramuscularly, with careful monitoring of blood pressure and physical state. As noted below, use of olanzapine or risperidone in elderly patients with dementia carries an increased risk of stroke and is not recommended (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-11">Committee on Safety of Medicines, 2004</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-18"><h2>Physical support</h2><p id="p-50">After parenteral rapid tranquillisation, monitor pulse, temperature, blood pressure and respiratory rate every 5&#x2013;10 min for the first hour, then every 30&#x2013;60 min until the patient is ambulatory. If the patient is unconscious or asleep, pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation is desirable. A nurse should remain with the patient until they are ambulatory. An electrocardiogram (ECG) should be recorded if there is any concern about cardiac function.</p><p id="p-51">Ensure a balanced diet and adequate fluids. Chart fluid intake if necessary. For patients on recently increased high-dose antipsychotics, check temperature, pulse and respiration every 6 h, and consider serial ECGs to pick up arrhythmia or QT prolongation. A screen of blood tests is helpful, to exclude serious coexisting or underlying pathology.</p><p id="p-52">All staff involved in administering or prescribing rapid tranquillisation or monitoring patients to whom parenteral rapid tranquillisation has been administered should receive ongoing training in adult life support techniques, to a minimum of immediate life support, and should be trained in the use of a pulse oximeter. A &#x2018;crash bag&#x2019; containing an automatic external defibrillator, a bag valve mask, oxygen, cannulas, fluids, suction and first-line resuscitation should be available within 3 min. A doctor should be available to attend the scene of a rapid tranquillisation intervention quickly and to remain at the scene until there is no further clinical concern about the patient.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-19"><h2>Choice of drug for rapid tranquillisation</h2></div><div class="section" id="sec-29"><h2>Route of administration of rapid tranquillisation</h2><p id="p-64">Whenever possible, rapid tranquillisation drugs should be given orally. It is sometimes necessary for these drugs to be administered by intramuscular injection while a patient is being restrained. Intravenous administration is the most hazardous route and should be limited to situations where immediate tranquillisation is deemed essential. This decision should not be made by junior staff in isolation, and the circumstances should be carefully recorded. Intravenous haloperidol or lorazepam should be used, with close monitoring of needs for immediate life support. The patient should not be left unattended.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-30"><h2>The use of restraint</h2><p id="p-65">The combination of a struggling patient, intramuscular injection and physical restraint must be considered a potentially dangerous mix (<a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-32">Kumar, 1997</a>; <a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-44">Paterson <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>).

There will be times when restraint is required for extended periods and this must be considered potentially very dangerous.

Research by the <a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-48">Royal College of Psychiatrists (2001)</a> has raised serious concerns about the basic standards for living or working in acute psychiatric units, noting that staff, patients and visitors often perceive wards as noisy, smelly and dirty. The Department of Health has published national minimum standards for psychiatric intensive care units, which also include useful guidance on effective physical environments (<a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-17">Department of Health, 2002</a>). The ideal is a therapeutic environment that allows individuals as much choice, privacy and independence as possible, and although there is little research in this area, it</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-37"><h2>Working with disturbed patients</h2><p id="p-83">Working with people who are acutely disturbed is difficult and carries significant risks for staff. The key intervention is often referred to as de-escalation, a form of communication intended to minimise aggression and disruptive behaviour. There is no standard de-escalation method, but the following approaches are important: maintaining a calm, controlled manner; giving choices; moving to a less confrontational or busy area; using the relationship with the patient to interact therapeutically. Training in de-escalation techniques aims to improve self-awareness in difficult, stressful circumstances and help staff to analyse the best approach in any given situation (<a id="xref-ref-20-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-20">Dix, 2001</a>).</p><p id="p-84">When a disturbance occurs it is vital that ward team members are clear about the management or treatment plan, know how it will be implemented and who is in charge. Patients should be involved as far as possible in planning what will be done should they become violent.</p><p id="p-85">During an incident, repeated clear explanations about what is being done and why ensures coordination and clarity within the team. The patient needs repeated reassurance and explanation that, as doctors and nurses, you are there to help. It is also important to explain that it is the aggressive or threatening behaviour that is the problem, and that the patient is not being punished and will not be harmed by the intervention. Patients are usually frightened or anxious and need repeated explanation of what is being done to them and why. Professionals involved in these complicated interventions must be aware that much violence results from patients&#x2019; fear and insecurity when they feel that they have no control over events. Therapeutic approaches that aim to restore control to the individual are likely to be of particular value. The doctor supervising treatment must stay at the scene until it is clear the situation is resolving and safe.</p><p id="p-86">Separation from stressful family relationships is often helpful in reducing anxiety and overstimulation.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-38"><h2>Observation</h2><p id="p-87">Four levels of observation of patients at risk of violence are in widespread clinical usage:</p><ul class="list-unord" id="list-5"><li id="list-item-16">
 <p id="p-89">general observation</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-17">
 <p id="p-90">intermittent observation</p>

 <p id="p-91">continuous observation, within sight</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-19">
 <p id="p-92">continuous observation, within arm&#x2019;s length.</p>
 </li></ul><p id="p-93">Observation must be carried out in a sensitive manner, minimising the patient&#x2019;s feeling of being under surveillance. Ideally, the patient and key nurse should discuss and plan it together and it should be the basis for risk assessment and management.</p><p id="p-94">An advisory report on nursing care for patients in the acute mental health setting noted that both patients and many nurses find prolonged observation a difficult and potentially countertherapeutic process that can be distressing for all concerned (<a id="xref-ref-50-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-50">Standing Nursing and Midwifery Advisory Committee, 1999</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-39"><h2>Staff safety</h2><p id="p-95">Staff can and should take precautions to reduce the occurrence or severity of assaults on them (Box 3<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-3"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 3</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Simple safety precautions for interviews with potentially violent patients</strong></h3>
 <ul class="list-unord" id="list-6"><li id="list-item-20">
 <p id="p-98">When interviewing a patient who has a potential for aggressive behaviour, always inform nursing staff of your intentions and location</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-21">
 <p id="p-99">Try to combine medical and nursing assessments, to protect interviewers and reduce stimulation of the patient</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-22">
 <p id="p-100">Be aware of the location of panic buttons, and if hand-held assault alarms are available request one and keep it on your person throughout the interview</p>
 </li><li id="list-item-23">
 <p id="p-101">Sit at an angle to the patient, at a safe distance, close to the exit: never interview with the patient between you and the door</p>
 </li></ul>
 </div><p id="p-102">Remember to put safety of people first. If a situation is escalating beyond the capacity of the hospital team to cope with it, call the hospital security service or dial (9)999 for emergency police help. Do not attempt restraint unless there is sufficient back-up (usually a three-person control and restraint specialist nursing team).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-40"><h2>Service user perspectives</h2><p id="p-103"><a id="xref-ref-17-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-17">The Department of Health (2002)</a> encourages mental health workers to adopt a non-judgemental, non-patronising, collaborative approach to care, and it is clear that environmental and attitudinal factors play a vital part in determining the outcome of emergency psychiatric treatment. In reality, some staff will have prejudicial and stereotypical views, and the possibility that patients who have exhibited disturbed behaviour may be given punitive treatment should be considered.</p><p id="p-104">Gender issues must also be taken seriously, and as far as possible we should ensure that patients feel safe and that their concerns are heard and attended to.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-41"><h2>Management after an incident</h2><p id="p-105">Senior staff, including the regular/on-call consultant, should be informed early of problems, and should be involved in regular discussion of progress thereafter. Multidisciplinary team meetings are an essential focus for management planning. The treatment regime should be reviewed regularly, initially at least at each nursing shift. It may be useful to involve the patient&#x2019;s family, particularly to ensure that the frequency of visiting is not causing problems of excess stimulation.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-42"><h2>Staff support after an incident</h2><p id="p-106">Despite preventive and coping strategies, aggressive incidents will happen, and there is a risk of exacerbating the victim&#x2019;s distress by unhelpful criticism of the way they handled the crisis. Victims need sympathy, support and reassurance, not just in the short term. Remember the stress of being exposed to a patient&#x2019;s aggression and paranoid criticism and hostility, and try to support colleagues and admit to your own frailties, anxieties and feelings of helplessness. It may be helpful to involve the partner or spouse, and in a severe reaction professional counselling should be considered. The issue of whether to prosecute the aggressor is one for the victim, who may be helped by talking it through with colleagues or managers.</p><p id="p-107">For professionals who have been assaulted, it is advisable to return to work as soon as possible (perhaps taking no time off), to prevent the &#x2018;incubation of fear&#x2019; that can occur.</p><p id="p-108">In the management of a serious aggressive incident, immediate safety must be secured before any investigation. The investigation should attempt as sensitively as possible to compile detailed reports about the incident, so that its causes, context and consequences for both staff and patients can be understood. The aim should be to create a positive, calm atmosphere, in which the incident can be reviewed honestly and openly and constructive lessons learned for the future.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-43"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-109">A key challenge for modern mental health services is to provide appropriate training and support for staff who work with acutely disturbed patients. We need to enable staff to develop the necessary skills, expertise and confidence to work in this difficult area. The clinical difficulties faced by professionals are often exacerbated by the need to work in poorly designed, inappropriate and unpleasant settings. Furthermore, low professional morale, staffing recruitment difficulties and the use of inexperienced locum staff inevitably affect patient care.</p><p id="p-110">However, we now have access to a range of clear, evidence-based guidelines to support practice. These also provide opportunities for audit and review of practice in a way that has previously been impossible. The Government (<a id="xref-ref-19-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/404#ref-19">Department of Health, 2005</a>) recently recommended the urgent implementation of a national system of training in restraint and control, and it seems likely that practice and understanding in this area will continue to develop, perhaps at an even greater pace, in the next few years.</p><p id="p-111">We believe that if we follow a considerate, supportive and humane approach to patients at this critical phase of their treatment, this can provide the foundation for continuing positive engagement with services and may have an important impact on long-term outcomes. We hope that the guidance in this article is of some assistance to colleagues who work in this difficult, challenging, but potentially rewarding area of practice.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-44"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-7"><li id="list-item-24">

 <p id="p-1">All psychiatrists should be able to construct a psychodynamic formulation of a case. A key advantage of formulation over diagnosis is that it can be used to predict how an individual might respond in certain situations and to various psychotherapies. This article looks in some depth at what psychiatric trainees need to be taught about psychodynamic formulation. We introduce formulation in terms of four levels, each level corresponding to a different degree of theoretical and clinical sophistication and therefore to different trainees&#x2019; needs. We use a case vignette to illustrate how a clinical situation might be formulated at each of these levels.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">We regard the capacity to formulate cases psycho-dynamically as a key clinical skill that all psychiatrists should be ready to apply to any case material. Its applications are potentially beneficial in many ways. Formulation should not have to wait until formal psychotherapy is being considered as a treatment option, and great theoretical sophistication is usually not required. An appreciation of the purpose of psychodynamic formulation is key not only to doing it effectively, but also to teaching it.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>The purpose of psychodynamic formulation</h2><p id="p-3">A psychodynamic formulation should summarise the dynamics of a clinical situation, allowing its apparent motivation to be grasped by someone who is otherwise unfamiliar with it. The formulation will explain the nature and timing of key developments up to the present and will facilitate predictions of what is likely to happen in the future. It incorporates a summary of relevant background information, alongside a series of systematic inferences drawn from this. As a clinical report, it must account for symptoms and disabilities in the light of adverse events and developmental patterns. As a psycho-dynamic explanation, it will discuss interpersonal and intrapsychic mechanisms. It is therefore likely to refer to internal conflict, developmental difficulties or unconscious processes.</p><p id="p-4">A psychodynamic formulation has a number of clinical uses. It helps any psychiatrist to see what a person is doing, thinking and feeling, and to explain why. It helps in anticipating how that person may behave in the future and how they may respond to adverse events and to different treatments. This is particularly relevant in the assessment of new patients for psychological therapies, where a principal task of the assessor is to arrive at an adequate formulation in order to make recommendations for further work. Formulation can also guide the treating psychotherapist by providing a map of treatment. This can be used by both therapist and supervisor to keep a treatment &#x2018;on track&#x2019; and also to evaluate the progress made as the treatment continues.</p><p id="p-5">The principal uses of formulation are summarised in Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>. Item 3 probably corresponds to the most commonly recognised function of formulation &#x2013; that it tries to provide a psychological account of why this patient is having this problem at this time. Items 5 and 6 are closely linked to item 3, in that a formulation of what is responsible for the onset and maintenance of difficulties will be used during the treatment designed to remove them, as well as in the evaluation of that treatment. These are not always appreciated in teaching about formulation. Items 1, 2 and 4 represent ways in which psychodynamic formulation remains useful irrespective of the aetiology of the presenting problem or the treatment that is eventually chosen. Unless the potential usefulness of formulation in understanding habitual ways of coping is appreciated, it will not be attempted as often as it should.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Clinical uses of psychodynamic formulation</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-14">Formulation also has educational value independent of its clinical usefulness. Asking for a formulation will provide evidence of a trainee&#x2019;s current capacity to think psychodynamically. In addition to the clinical uses summarised in Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>, formulation is useful as a tool with which trainees can be helped to organise ideas, and through which their growing competence in psychodynamic thinking might be assessed.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Formulation <em>v</em>. diagnosis</h2><p id="p-15">At first glance, some of the functions of formulation can appear to be those of diagnosis. Although diagnosis and formulation share an interest in summarisation and in prediction, they remain distinct (Table 1<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#T2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>). We believe it is essential to grasp how psychodynamic formulation differs from a psychiatric diagnosis in order to understand what formulation is about. A diagnosis is generally thought of as a summary label such as paranoid schizophrenia or dysthymic disorder. Ideally, it should be more than this, being a multi-axial summary of psychiatric syndromes, personality, non-psychiatric illness, social and situational factors. However, it rarely takes this form in practice. Furthermore, although multi-axial diagnosis potentially offers information about more aspects of a patient&#x2019;s current state, its statistical function means that descriptors under any given heading will always be chosen from a limited menu of standardised terms. All diagnosis therefore remains fundamentally an exercise in naming what this patient has in common with others, leaving it to formulation to identify and explain what is unique about this patient&#x2019;s presentation.</p><div class="table pos-float" id="T2"><div class="table-inline"></div><div class="table-caption"><span class="table-label"><strong>Table 1</strong> </span> <p id="p-133" class="first-child"><strong>Some basic differences between diagnosis and formulation</strong></p></div></div><p id="p-16">Diagnosis requires that information about symptoms and signs be gathered from a mental state examination and a history be taken that provides facts concerning several types of event in the patient&#x2019;s life. These are matched against the criteria for candidate diagnoses in order that the most appropriate ones can be selected.</p><p id="p-17">Formulation requires additional kinds of information, such as a sense of how the patient feels and responds in a variety of situations. It is concerned with why events have followed one another and the meaning of these for the patient. Apart from detailed questioning, the interviewer may use the experience of being with the patient to gather information. For instance, the way patient and assessor interact and how a trained assessor feels after an interview can help him or her to infer characteristic ways in which the patient responds to painful experiences and relates to others.</p><p id="p-18">Although psychiatric diagnoses always identify a recognised cluster of symptoms, they differ from most other medical diagnoses in their failure (or refusal) to refer to a presumed cause or aetiology for these. Diagnostic terms are also expected to avoid theoretical connotations. However, the explanatory nature of formulation means that it is inevitably theory laden. Moreover, there can be distinct levels of sophistication (or esotericism) in the theory that is used.</p><p id="p-19">One longstanding function of diagnosis is that it should aid prediction of what is likely to happen. The disorder that a diagnosis names is presumed to have a typical history. Yet there are real differences in the utility of this predictive function: most diagnoses in psychiatry are indistinguishable on the basis of their natural history, lacking the predictability of organic syndromes such as the dementias. Formulation, however, strives to take sufficient factors into account to differentiate one individual&#x2019;s expected prognosis from another&#x2019;s. Its predictive validity can be checked only against subsequent events. If things develop in unexpected directions, the formulation is likely to need modification even if the patient&#x2019;s diagnosis is unchanged.</p><p id="p-20">Diagnosis is also expected to be a guide to treatment. In other medical specialties, there is a close link between this function and what the diagnosis conveys about aetiology and prognosis. Although this function is relatively weak for most psychiatric diagnoses, the current rules of evidence-based practice are reinforcing expectations that an accurate diagnosis carries clear implications for treatment. In the field of psychological treatments, however, diagnosis by itself remains a poor way of choosing a treatment that is likely to be effective. There are real differences between individuals in their responsiveness to most treatment methods, but diagnosis remains a poorer guide to prognosis than other patient characteristics such as defensive style (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-8">Perry, 1993</a>). An argument can therefore be made that, in drawing on other kinds of clinical knowledge, formulation provides a sounder basis than diagnosis on which to identify and choose treatments.</p><p id="p-21">Formulation comes into its own in providing a blueprint of the likely targets to be addressed during a treatment in order for the presenting difficulties to be resolved. It is a reference against which the actual outcome of the treatment can be judged. Although its content may be unique to an individual patient, it is possible for formulation to follow a systematic method that produces comparable results with different formulators, facilitating its use in the routine assessment of clinical progress (for an example, see <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-6">Malan &amp; Orsimo,1990</a>).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>What is a formulation like?</h2><p id="p-22">One of the reasons why it is difficult to give (or even to find) examples of psychodynamic formulations is that there is no generally agreed format for them to follow. Some significant attempts have been made (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-9">Perry <em>et al</em>, 1987</a>; <a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-1">Aveline, 1999</a>; <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-3">Kassaw &amp; Gabbard, 2002</a>), but these tend to confirm that &#x2018;psychodynamic formulation&#x2019; has been linked to a range of types of summary rather than a universal model. There can also be confusion over the distinction between diagnosis and formulation: the term &#x2018;case formulation&#x2019; is sometimes encountered as inclusive of both diagnosis and psychoydnamic formulation (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-2">Eells <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>). Furthermore, psychodynamic formulations proper vary in the thoroughness of the explanation that is sought, as well as the theoretical sophistication with which it is expressed. While explanation is key to proficiency at formulation, a survey (<a id="xref-ref-2-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-2">Eells <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>) has confirmed our own impression that many &#x2018;formulations&#x2019; remain essentially descriptive, without a full transition to explanation and prediction.</p><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><h3>The four-level model</h3><p id="p-23">We shall distinguish between different levels of formulation in terms of what they demand from the clinician (Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-2"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 2</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Four levels of psychodynamic formulation</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-30">First comes an appreciation that factors specific to the patient are necessary in explaining what has happened to this person, even if their contribution cannot be clearly articulated. Second comes a willingness to draw these and other known facts together. This will yield a narrative account of the individual&#x2019;s situation that conveys an understanding of why things happened in the way they did. Third is an attempt to think about these summarily. This combines systematic identification of past and present factors that explain the onset and maintenance of difficulties with some conceptualisation of conflicts that underpin the patient&#x2019;s disclosures and actions. A summary of this kind should be sufficiently cogent to permit prediction about future behaviour. At the final, fourth level, explanation is assisted by sufficient psychodynamic theory for the formulation to be systematically articulated and refined. Theory is most useful as a foundation for descriptions of individuals&#x2019; underlying strengths and vulnerabilities; in providing a consistent framework for identification of conflicts with which their symptoms are associated; and in describing enduring aspects of their interpersonal style. The differences between these levels will become clearer using the following case vignette as illustration.</p><p id="p-31">Case vignette: Arthur</p><p id="p-32">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">Arthur is a married man of 35 who works as an accountant. He was referred after being taken by his wife to his general practitioner (GP). He had been lying in bed for days and then she found him searching in their attic in the dark. He refused to tell the GP what he was doing there, but on questioning admitted to very interrupted sleep, loss of appetite and feeling worthless. He had been expressing fears that he was incapable of doing his job well for several weeks beforehand. He had stopped working, was staying indoors and had begun to express a view that others would be better off without him. He told the GP he was very afraid his wife would leave him, although he could not explain why.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-1">Arthur is reluctant to talk about his past and tells enquirers everything was &#x2018;fine&#x2019;. He has no formal psychiatric history although his GP had recommended he see a psychiatrist when he had taken several weeks off school at the age of 13. He had also been unable to work for several weeks when a girlfriend left him in his early 20s. His wife described him as a workaholic and a perfectionist who was devastated if he made a small mistake.</q>
 </p></div><div id="sec-6" class="subsection"><h3>Level 2: Constructing an illness narrative</h3><p id="p-37">The intelligibility of the patient&#x2019;s story increases as an account is developed that links past and present. This indicates when major changes in the patient&#x2019;s subjective experience occurred and what may have brought them about.</p><p id="p-38">Let us continue with the vignette.</p><p id="p-39">
 <q id="disp-quote-2">Further interviewing reveals more aspects to Arthur&#x2019;s story. At first he has simply described his father as &#x2018;old-fashioned&#x2019; and &#x2018;strict&#x2019;. Subsequently, he provides illustrations of how his father used to berate him in front of family and friends for being stupid, leading Arthur to believe that his school reports were never good enough. While he feared his father more than his mother, he was never sure that she would defend him. When he had shown his mother how unhappy his father&#x2019;s taunts made him, she became unwell and went to stay with her sister, leaving Arthur to face his father&#x2019;s sarcasm alone. Although Arthur was too afraid even to think of arguing with his father, he remembered feeling vengeful and becoming bullying towards his younger sister, whom his father adored.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-2">While at school, Arthur had tried to work hard. When he was bullied for a period he had been afraid to ask for any help, but had to see the headmaster because he lost his temper and savagely beat another boy after one attack too many. It was shortly after this reprimand he became so withdrawn that the GP was called in and psychiatric assessment considered. Arthur spoke of feeling humiliated by the whole experience. After leaving school he had been mostly studious, but would become quite violent if he drank too much. He was cautioned by the police on one such occasion, and his girlfriend said she would have nothing more to do with him. Arthur recalls feeling abandoned and also being terrified his name would appear in the newspaper just before he spent several weeks off work with what he refers to as &#x2018;depression&#x2019;.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-2">Turning to recent events, Arthur admits to having felt under pressure from his wife to ask his boss for some leave. The plan was for Arthur to look after their young disabled son while his wife went to a family wedding abroad. His boss had refused, saying the company was too busy to spare him at the time he wanted to go. Arthur took this as a rebuke that he had not worked hard enough to allow him time off. He suppressed any wish to argue with his boss, but felt inadequate afterwards. This feeling increased after his wife upbraided him at home for letting her down and for not being firm enough. Arthur found himself shouting at their son and felt very guilty at this. Just days later he was found in the attic.</q>
 </p><p id="p-43">The narrative that has built up now gives a more comprehensive picture of how Arthur experienced particular events. It puts the appearance of his symptoms in the context of exposure to increasingly intense and unwelcome feelings (of shame, resentment, rejection and guilt) with him feeling increasingly useless before he withdraws from his family.</p></div><div id="sec-7" class="subsection"><h3>Level 3: Modelling a formulation</h3><p id="p-44">The aim at this stage is to acquire a more structured and dynamic understanding of how different pathogenic factors operate and interrelate with each other.</p><p id="p-45">The traditional framework of predisposing, precipitating and maintaining factors can be adopted in a selective reorganisation of information that has been gathered during systematic enquiry. This allows statement of one or more conflicts between conscious or unconscious wishes that underpin the persistence of the presenting problem and the (often underestimated) distress it brings. Whether or not the patient immediately recognises the conflict, there is no place for jargon or shorthand here. Too often, jargon can be a cloak for sloppy thinking. It can also lead to confusion because different people can mean very different things by terms such as Oedipal, narcissistic and psychotic.</p><p id="p-46">In Arthur&#x2019;s case, we might see factors predisposing him to depression in his mother&#x2019;s tendency to respond to his needs with avoidance, leading him to fear being abandoned if he expresses them; and in his father&#x2019;s very critical and demanding attitude, which has left him fearful of criticism and humiliation.</p><p id="p-47">Precipitating features include shame in relation to perceived criticism of his work; helplessness in the context of the recent confrontation with someone in authority (his boss); and a sense of abandonment following his wife&#x2019;s criticisms and withdrawal from him. These are reflected in ideas noted on mental state examination such as his apparently irrational fear of being abandoned by his wife.</p><p id="p-48">Maintaining factors usually divide into internal and external ones, the former being most likely to be overlooked. Arthur has clearly internalised a tendency to be harshly critical of himself, which is likely to be self-fulfilling because it is reinforced by his perfectionism. This means he sets standards that are impossible to meet, resulting in frequent self-criticism. Other maintaining factors can involve vicious cycles between his own actions and others&#x2019; subsequent responses to these. An example is how Arthur&#x2019;s angry outbursts might lead others to shun him and he might feel very ashamed about his behaviour. However, if his sense of inadequacy persists, he may remain liable to extreme anger at the slightest provocation, perpetuating the problem. In Arthur&#x2019;s case, things are quite complicated. Other external maintaining factors that are evident include a work environment where his boss&#x2019;s behaviour appears likely to reinforce his internal fears of being criticised and humiliated, and a home where his wife&#x2019;s apparent ambivalence can reinforce his longstanding fear of being abandoned when he seeks unconditional support.</p><p id="p-49">This analysis allows us to see which features of Arthur&#x2019;s story have particular dynamic significance and how different factors, past and present, interact. It also helps inference concerning the dynamic core of Arthur&#x2019;s difficulties. We recommend that this is expressed in terms of a conflict between the wishes or impulses that the patient evidently finds it hard to realise and the psychological factors that oppose these. Arthur&#x2019;s case can be understood in terms of a conflict between asserting himself and his fears of being crushed and abandoned if he does so.</p><p id="p-50">The features we believe a simple psychodynamic formulation should include are summarised in Box 3<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-3"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 3</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Features of simple psychodynamic formulation</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-60">A model of this kind allows simple predictive hypotheses to be made about how patients are likely to react in future, including their relationships with professional helpers. In our example, Arthur could be said to be particularly vulnerable to becoming depressed (and to withdrawing) in situations where he is faced with demanding behaviour that he feels he cannot resist, or where he is likely to interpret apparently inconsequential events as meaning he is about to be abandoned.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-9"><h2>A formulation model</h2><p id="p-62">One recent method for devising psychodynamic formulations that are theoretically coherent as well as reliable proposes a dimensional approach. Drawing on many previously proposed templates for psychodynamic formulation, operationalised psychodynamic diagnostics (or OPD) incorporates three truly dynamic dimensions. These concern enduring structural factors such as defensive style and attachment patterns; characteristic patterns of interpersonal relations (and the feelings typically associated with these); and conflicts that currently underpin a patient&#x2019;s preoccupations or distress. They are summarised in Boxes 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-4-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-4"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>&#x2013;6<a id="xref-boxed-text-6-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-6"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> and discussed in further detail below. The system is grounded in object relations theory, but its terminology is eclectic. A complete OPD formulation also includes two other dimensions &#x2013; one for the patient&#x2019;s experience of illness and prerequisites for treatment, the other for a standard (ICD) diagnosis. We confine description here to aspects of the three psychodynamic dimensions that recommend it as a device for teaching sophisticated formulation; a full account may be found in the literature (OPD <a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-7">Task Force, 2001</a>).</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-4"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 4</strong> </span> <h3><strong>OPD dimensions of structure</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-86">By requiring the dimensions of structure, relationships and conflict to be thought about independently for each patient, and by providing nomenclature and a system for noting the conclusions that are reached, the OPD system helps clinicians to produce a consistently structured formulation covering intra-psychic and interpersonal dynamics. As well as increasing the explanatory value of a formulation, the system enables clinical teams conversant with the underlying theoretical model to communicate effectively about patients&#x2019; needs, vulnerabilities and likely responses.</p><p id="p-87">In clinical practice, production of a psycho-dynamically articulate formulation needs to draw both on observations available only during active interaction with a patient and on reported information. This is evident from the requirement to base formulation of a patient&#x2019;s characteristic interpersonal behaviours on observations of others&#x2019; experiences of the patient and of how the patient repeatedly makes them feel. Interviewers&#x2019; own observations of how a patient makes them feel (i.e. their countertransference to the patient) are indispensable for this.</p><p id="p-88">To return to our case example, consider now what happened once Arthur was referred for further interview with a (male) psychiatrist experienced in psychotherapy.</p><p id="p-89">
 <q id="disp-quote-3">Arthur rang up on the day of his appointment to try to cancel the interview, but an experienced secretary persuaded him to attend. He presented as a rather worn man, older than his years, who looked anxious and haunted as well as downcast. Explaining his attempt to cancel the appointment, he said that he had felt someone else was bound to make better use of the appointment than himself and he had not wanted to waste anybody&#x2019;s time. He admitted to feeling anxious in a way that had become much worse that morning. When the assessor suggested he may also have been worried about being judged if he came, he agreed that was so. He talked about how he was often worried about this and how he was frequently judged very unfairly by others, citing his boss&#x2019;s disapproval of him. The psychiatrist encouraged him to say why he felt his boss was disapproving of him and Arthur started to recount how his leave was refused. When the interviewer commented that the boss may have behaved as he did because he valued Arthur&#x2019;s work, Arthur checked himself, becoming less willing to talk about his boss and looking at the assessor with more reserve. Arthur commented rather sharply that his wife had felt the interview would not get anywhere either. The psychiatrist asked him carefully what it was that his wife had said about him coming to the assessment. After a very significant pause, Arthur replied that she had said it wouldn&#x2019;t do any good if he tried to hide things and because he was bound to do so it would be &#x2018;another offer wasted&#x2019;. His interviewer suggested Arthur must be feeling very trapped between other people&#x2019;s demands on him. Arthur clenched his fists, staring at the psychiatrist, then looked away, before starting to sob quietly.</q>
 </p><p id="p-91">The psychiatrist was moved by this encounter and took care to record his feelings. These ranged from irritation at Arthur&#x2019;s attempts to back off to a wish to protect him from others&#x2019; unreasonable demands. Taking what was already known together with these observations of how Arthur had behaved, it was possible to sketch an outline of positions Arthur adopted in relation to others that appeared relatively fixed and repetitive. For instance, Arthur&#x2019;s experience of others as blaming and demanding leads him to react with an (unfulfilled) wish to attack them and by isolating himself. This causes others to experience him as subtly attacking and as withdrawing from them, and they are left feeling he does not want them but that they should protect him. Arthur, however, experiences these attempts to protect him as controlling and he further withdraws. Once others react instead to their irritation by wanting to get rid of him, he is very sensitive to this and feels abandoned. Recurrent cycles of interaction based on the identified core experiences are set out in just this way within a formulation of interpersonal relations.</p><p id="p-92">In describing conflict, the principal types listed in Box 6<a id="xref-boxed-text-6-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-6"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a> need to be considered. Although more than one type is often present, precedence is given to those deemed most significant in their impact, whatever their position in the list. From what is known about Arthur (and we still have relatively little information about his relationships with his current family), two types of conflict are particularly prominent. Submission <em>v</em>. control seems to organise his (passive) orientation to his boss and wife, and his difficulties in establishing a comfortable position in relation to his own control induce much resistant behaviour before and during the interview. A second prominent conflict, the desire for care <em>v</em>. autarchy (being self-sufficient), intersects with this in Arthur&#x2019;s life: his usual passive willingness to enjoy being cared for in a way that emphasises his sense of need and others&#x2019; autonomy relative to his own leaves him particularly exposed at the moments the interviewer refused to go along with these expectations.</p><p id="p-93">Systematic consideration of the character traits in the dimension of structure (Box 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-4-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-4"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>) reveals the degree of integration Arthur shows with each one. They are each compromised to a moderate degree: compromised self-perception is evident in the dominance of negative feelings and his response to stress; in self-regulation he overregulates aggressive impulses and esteem; impaired maturity of defenses in the rigidity of his obsessionality; his perception of others and of their feelings is inconsistent and rigidly limited (as in the earlier formulation of interpersonal relations). This also compromises his capacity to communicate with others (as seen in the interview) and the attachments he forms in his relationships (as in his presenting account).</p><p id="p-94">This kind of formulation therefore provides a detailed psychodynamic footprint across the interconnected aspects of relations, conflict and internal structure, but names these in a way that facilitates reference to psychodynamic theory. (The full OPD system also provides a way of systematically recording a patient&#x2019;s attitudes to illness and treatment.) Operationalised psychodynamic diagnostics is not the only way of achieving this, and it is continuing to develop through field tests. Among other objectives, these are identifying when items on the different axes are most likely to be associated, so that the clinical significance of particular patterns becomes clearer. As it stands, OPD can be applied by experienced raters with relatively good reliability and it therefore recommends itself for teaching (reliability has been found to be highest for the structural items (Box 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-4-3" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#boxed-text-4"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>) when experienced raters formulate video sequences (M. Cierpka, personal communication, 2005)).</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-10"><h2>Making a formulation in practice</h2><p id="p-95">As we hope our model makes clear, what needs to go into a formulation will depend on the type of formulation it is. An active process of gathering information before formulating will be necessary &#x2013;what Harry Stack <a id="xref-ref-10-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/416#ref-10">Sullivan (1953)</a> referred to as &#x2018;reconnaisance&#x2019; before &#x2018;summarising&#x2019;. Quite detailed information is likely to be necessary about early life and previous crises as well as the onset of recent difficulties, to allow likely predisposing and precipitating factors to be identified.</p><p id="p-96">In the course of an interview, questions need to focus on eliciting the patient&#x2019;s subjective feelings and meanings behind possibly significant events. In judging the significance of these, interviewers should be guided by the way in which patients express themselves.</p><p id="p-97">In addition to this form of history-taking, the interviewer should also be making observations based on the interview itself. This becomes especially important in level 4 formulation, which can help aspects of interpersonal dynamics and conflict to be defined that were not readily apparent at level 3. From the first moments of the encounter, observations should be made concerning how the patient reacts towards the interviewer. Are they unduly timid, assertive, seductive, aloof and so on &#x2013; and what might this signify in terms of characteristic dynamic patterns? How do they behave when talking (or avoiding talking) about their feelings? Interviewers need also to monitor their own feelings, noting when these appear to be a response to the patient that was not previously present, rather than a response to unrelated events or thoughts.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-11"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-98">Psychodynamic formulation needs to be understood and valued as a process distinct from psychiatric diagnosis. To produce a formulation, it is necessary to have a clear idea of what should go into it and what the product should look like. Formulation styles appropriate for senior house officers and specialist registrars are described here. The final formulation will always depend on the interaction between patient and psychiatrist and the latter&#x2019;s clinical acumen, as well as the patient&#x2019;s predicament.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-12"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-8"><li id="list-item-35">

 <p id="p-1">Sexually disinhibited behaviours are quite common (prevalence 2&#x2013;17%) in people with dementia, occurring with about equal frequency in men and women. Assessment of the behaviours, the contexts in which they arise and their risks is essential. It is important to manage the environment and to educate and discuss the issues with carers and families. Behavioural measures are helpful, although no specific behavioural intervention has been shown to be effective in this area. Several classes of drug may help to control the behaviours, but all are potentially harmful and none is licensed for hypersexuality in this population.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Case study</p><p id="p-3">
 <q id="disp-quote-1">Mr A, aged 83, presented at an accident and emergency department, where he was verbally abusive and physically aggressive. A mild cognitive impairment was noted and he was admitted to the psychiatric hospital under section 2 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Episodes of aggression, although not sexual behaviour, continued. After 6 months in hospital he was discharged under guardianship to a residential home, where he would sometimes threaten people with his stick. He always refused all medication. Four years later the aggression had worsened and he was readmitted to the general hospital with an infection, and transferred on section back to the psychiatric hospital. By this time his cognitive impairment had progressed and a diagnosis of dementia was made. Further aggression occurred on the ward. Several months later he was discharged to a nursing home, still refusing medication.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-1">In the home he now began to approach a female resident with sexual suggestions. Initially the staff managed this by moving him to a different floor, but the behaviour continued with other residents and he was readmitted to hospital because of the difficulty of managing it. On the first day in hospital he began to initiate sexually inappropriate behaviour with female patients who themselves had dementia. He became angry and threatening if staff intervened, for example to ask him to return to his room. He would also hit other patients with his stick if angry. Behavioural strategies were tried with only very limited success. Eventually the team came to the view that the level of risk to others was unacceptable despite the behavioural measures used, and he was detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 with a view to managing his behaviour with medication. The plan was to initiate this orally, but he refused, and so an intramuscular injection of 25 mg chlorpromazine was given to test his response to antipsychotic medication (which he had never had before). This was followed a week later by an injection of short-acting zuclopenthixol acetate (50 mg) and a week after that a depot injection of zuclopenthixol decanoate (50 mg). The depot was continued at monthly intervals. Over the next 2 months the disinhibited behaviours reduced, although he developed moderate extrapyramidal side-effects.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-1">He was discharged on the depot on leave to a nursing home. However, despite being given full information about his legal status (which authorised the use of the depot even without his consent) and the reason for giving the depot, staff at the home did not feel able to administer it to him. The sexual behaviours began to return very intrusively. He repeatedly mutually masturbated a mentally incompetent female resident, who appeared to enjoy his attentions. The home found it difficult to discuss the situation with that person&#x2019;s husband. He touched and kissed other residents as well. He was moved to another wing, but managed to get back into the original wing.</q>
 <q id="disp-quote-1">When this became known he was recalled to hospital. A few weeks later he developed a chest infection, but refused treatment and died.</q>

In a study of 40 people with dementia living in a long-term care home, <a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-48">Zeiss <em>et al</em>(1996)</a> systematically observed each of the residents on nine separate 5-minute occasions, coding for each minute of observation whether a sexual behaviour was present and if so whether it was appropriate, inappropriate or ambiguous. Examples of inappropriate behaviour were: making explicit sexual comments, touching someone other than a partner on the breast or genitals, touching a partner on the breast or genitals in public, exposing breasts or genitals in public. Many behaviours were coded as ambiguous, for example being undressed outside the bedroom or bathroom, or sitting with stilled hands cupped over genitals. Of the 1800 one-minute segments coded, inappropriate behaviour occurred in 27 (1.6%) and ambiguous behaviours in 67 (3.7%). Only 18% of the individuals ever displayed inappropriate behaviour during observation, and a similar proportion, 20%, displayed appropriate sexual behaviour. A further 28% showed ambiguous behaviour.</p><p id="p-11">There is no widely agreed definition of when a behaviour becomes abnormal, and so the decision is usually based either on a judgement of what is normal for a person in a particular situation (which is likely to be different according to whether they are in their own home, in a residential home or in hospital), or on the level of risk or discomfort to others. Little research has been carried out on the expression of sexuality in older people on which to base a judgement of what is normal, particularly in institutional settings, and it may be preferable to give greater attention to whether those involved experience the behaviour as distressing rather than whether it is normal.</p><p id="p-12">Boxes 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> and 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> list major factors in the aetiology of changes in sexual behaviour in dementia.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Why does sexual behaviour decrease in dementia?</strong></h3>

Carers expect to help these people with their personal care and basic physical needs. Yet the lack of explicit discussion of sexual behaviour in older people often makes carers uneasy about even noticing such behaviours, let alone assisting or allowing those in their care to satisfy their needs. In Zeiss <em>et al</em>&#x2019;s study cited above, staff did not respond to any of 94 episodes of sexually inappropriate or ambiguous behaviour (although another patient did), and staff ignored 10 out of 17 appropriate sexual behaviours.</p><p id="p-39">Sexual behaviour can also present risks of harm or discomfort to those involved and their families, and people with dementia can themselves be very vulnerable to exploitation and distress. In deciding how to react to sexual behaviour, staff and institutions must consider the legal and ethical framework within which they work.</p><p id="p-40">Box 3<a id="xref-boxed-text-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#boxed-text-3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> summarises the assessment of competency. At both legal and ethical levels, the patient&#x2019;s competence is central. If a patient in an institution is not competent to decide whether he or she wishes to proceed with a sexual contact, the staff have a duty of care towards him or her to ensure that no harm results. Whether it is ethical for a non-competent patient to take part in a sexual contact of any sort is a difficult decision which will need to be carefully considered in the light of the person&#x2019;s background and previous choices, and the nature of the contact. It will normally be helpful to discuss the situation with the patient&#x2019;s family.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-3"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 3</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Assessment of competency to engage in a sexual relationship (after Lichtenberg &amp; <a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-28">Strzepek, 1990</a>)</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-52">For a competent patient, the situation is ethically clearer in that the choice is primarily for the patient to make. Staff may have a role in supporting this decision (for example by ensuring access to private space). Attitudes of staff are very variable, and teams will need to discuss these issues explicitly to ensure that staff are adequately trained and supported. <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-3">Barrett (2004)</a> engagingly describes the difficulties that arose when an elderly non-demented man living in a residential home wished to pay for sexual services from female visitors.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>Assessment</h2><p id="p-53">Clear assessment of the behaviours displayed is essential for a balanced management plan to be developed. A full understanding of both the behaviours and the contexts in which they occur is required. This is best based on direct observation and discussion, either using a standardised system such as dementia care mapping (<a id="xref-ref-18-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-18">Kitwood &amp; Bredin, 1992</a>) or, more commonly, written observational records made by care staff. Clinical psychologists and other professionals can be very helpful in defining and analysing the behaviours, as well as managing them. A simple and convenient general method of recording behaviours is known as the ABC system, where staff record the antecedents (A), behaviours themselves (B) and consequences (C) (for an account of the system see <a id="xref-ref-46-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-46">Wells, 1997</a>: pp. 36&#x2013;37). It is important to know the frequencies of the behaviours, what they are, when and where they occur, and with whom. The effects of interventions cannot be properly evaluated without good baseline records.</p><p id="p-54">Since many of the interventions discussed below themselves carry risks, it is important to balance the risks presented by the behaviour against those of the intervention. Predisposing factors, physical, psychiatric and social need should also be reviewed.</p><p id="p-55">Box 4<a id="xref-boxed-text-4-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#boxed-text-4"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> summarises the goals of assessment.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-4"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 4</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Assessment of sexually disinhibited behaviour</strong></h3>

These agents decrease testosterone levels, which may reduce sexual drive (<a id="xref-ref-41-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-41">Schiavi &amp; White, 1976</a>).

The hypothalamus produces gonadotrophin-releasing hormone, which stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Luteinising hormone stimulates the release of testosterone from the testes.</p><p id="p-95">Circulating testosterone levels are maintained by a homoeostatic mechanism. When circulating testosterone levels decrease, an increase in production is promoted by luteinising hormone, which in turn is stimulated by LHRH. An increase in testosterone levels has an inhibitory effect on the hypothalamus and the pituitary.</p><div id="sec-14" class="subsection"><h4>Oestrogens</h4><p id="p-102">Oestrogens (estrone, estradiol and diethylstilbestrol) have a strong negative feedback effect on hypothalamic and pituitary hormone secretion. They decrease luteinising hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone production, which leads to a reduction in the production of testosterone.</p><p id="p-103">There are few reports on the use of oestrogens for the treatment of hypersexuality in people with dementia, possibly because of the greater presence of cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk factors in the older population and the association between cardiovascular-related deaths and oestrogen use in men treated with diethylstilbestrol for prostate cancer (Levitsky &amp; <a id="xref-ref-26-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-26">Owens, 1999</a>).</p><p id="p-104">In one study, although few details are given, a marked improvement in sexual behaviour was seen in 38 out of 39 men with cognitive impairment when treated with oral oestrogen (0.625 mg/day) or with transdermal oestrogen patches (0.005&#x2013;0.1 mg) (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/424#ref-29">Lothstein <em>et al</em>, 1997</a>).

 <p id="p-1">Psychiatrists rarely enquire about caffeine intake when assessing patients. This may lead to a failure to identify caffeine-related problems and offer appropriate interventions. Excessive caffeine ingestion leads to symptoms that overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. Caffeine is implicated in the exacerbation of anxiety and sleep disorders, and people with eating disorders often misuse it. It antagonises adenosine receptors, which may potentiate dopaminergic activity and exacerbate psychosis. In psychiatric in-patients, caffeine has been found to increase anxiety, hostility and psychotic symptoms. Assessment of caffeine intake should form part of routine psychiatric assessment and should be carried out before prescribing hypnotics. Gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on psychiatric wards.</p>

 </p><p id="p-6">Caffeine is the most widely used psychoactive drug in the world. It is found in more than 60 known species of plants, and dietary sources include coffee, tea, cocoa beverages, chocolate and soft drinks. Coffee was consumed in Arabia in the 13th century and was introduced into Europe in the early 17th century. Tea was probably drunk in China before the birth of Christ and was brought to Europe in the 16th century. Most dietary caffeine is still consumed as tea and coffee, and the latter accounts for 55% of per capita intake in the UK (<a id="xref-ref-63-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-63">Scott <em>et al</em>, 1989</a>). Despite (or perhaps because of) its ubiquity, caffeine is rarely thought of as a problematic drug. Doctors do not often ask patients about its use and enquiry into caffeine consumption is not usually included in psychiatric assessment.</p><p id="p-7">On average, a cup of brewed coffee contains 100 mg of caffeine, compared with 75 mg for instant coffee and 50 mg for tea (<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-23">Food Standards Agency, 2001</a>); a can of Coca Cola contains 30 mg. Increasingly, stimulant drinks such as Red Bull (80 mg of caffeine per can) are being marketed to the public, and sales have increased dramatically since they first became available in 1987 (<a id="xref-ref-22-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-22">Finnegan, 2003</a>). Pharmaceutical caffeine may be bought over the counter (for example as ProPlus tablets) and is also contained in numerous proprietary analgesics, cold and &#x2019;flu remedies, diet pills and diuretics; Anadin Extra, for example, contains 90 mg of caffeine per dose. In the UK, mean caffeine consumption is estimated at 359 mg/day (<a id="xref-ref-63-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-63">Scott <em>et al</em>, 1989</a>).</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Effects and diagnostic classification</h2><p id="p-8">The primary effect of caffeine is to relieve fatigue and enhance mental performance. Excessive ingestion leads to a state of intoxication known as caffeinism, which is characterised by restlessness, agitation, excitement, rambling thought and speech, and insomnia. These symptoms clearly overlap with those of many psychiatric disorders. The potential harmful effects of caffeine have long been recognised. As long ago as 1900, the <em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em> reported a conference on &#x2018;Coffee as a beverage: its deleterious effects on the nervous system&#x2019;, at which a contributor complained that &#x2018;most physicians had given the subject little if any attention&#x2019;.

Caffeine withdrawal is included in the Appendix to DSM&#x2013;IV under &#x2018;Criteria sets and axes provided for further study&#x2019;. The ICD&#x2013;10 (<a id="xref-ref-74-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-74">World Health Organization, 1992</a>) is less specific. It recognises &#x2018;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of other stimulants, including caffeine&#x2019; (F15), which are then sub-classified in the same way as other substance use disorders (acute intoxication, harmful use, dependence syndrome, withdrawal state, etc.). However, there is no specific guidance on diagnosing problems due to caffeine misuse, and the diagnostic criteria are the same as for other substance use disorders. The prevalence of the various caffeine-related syndromes is uncertain.</p><p id="p-10">Despite this formal recognition, caffeine generally receives little attention from psychiatrists.

Consequently, psychiatrists rarely enquire about caffeine intake when assessing patients. This may lead to a failure to identify caffeine-related problems and offer appropriate interventions.</p><p id="p-11">This article describes the clinical effects of caffeine consumption in a variety of psychiatric disorders and offers some guidance on assessing and managing caffeine-related problems.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Biochemistry and pharmacology of caffeine</h2><p id="p-12">Caffeine is a methylxanthine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine). The effects of this group of chemicals include stimulation of the central nervous system (CNS), diuresis, stimulation of cardiac muscle and relaxation of smooth muscle. Caffeine initially stimulates the CNS at the level of the cerebral cortex and medulla and only later stimulates the spinal cord (at higher doses). Its effects begin within 1 h and last for 3&#x2013;4 h (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-3">Baker &amp; Theologus, 1972</a>). Caffeine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and then metabolised by demethylation and oxidation in the liver. There is some individual variation in the rate of metabolism; the half-life is reduced in smokers but increased in pregnancy and in women taking oral contraceptives (<a id="xref-ref-22-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-22">Finnegan, 2003</a>).</p><p id="p-13">Biochemically, the main action of caffeine is anatagonism of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> receptors. Higher doses cause inhibition of phosphodiesterases, blockade of &#x3B3;-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors and release of intracellular calcium (<a id="xref-ref-14-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-14">Daly &amp; Fredholm, 1998</a>; <a id="xref-ref-22-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-22">Finnegan, 2003</a>). Neuropsychiatric effects are mediated largely by blockade of A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the CNS. Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors are present in almost all brain areas, but particularly in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex and thalamus.</p><p id="p-14">There are important connections between adenosine receptors and the dopaminergic system, which may be relevant to the effects of caffeine in psychosis (see below, in the subsection &#x2018;Schizophrenia&#x2019;). Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors are concentrated in the dopamine-rich regions of the brain and are thought to have considerable links with dopaminergic receptors (<a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-20">Ferre <em>et al</em>, 1992</a>; <a id="xref-ref-47-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-47">Lorist &amp; Tops, 2003</a>). Moreover, there is evidence that the stimulatory effects of caffeine require intact dopaminergic neurotransmission (<a id="xref-ref-20-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-20">Ferre <em>et al</em>, 1992</a>). These stimulatory effects appear to result primarily from blockade of A<sub>2A</sub> receptors, which stimulate inhibitory GABAergic neurons in pathways to the dopaminergic reward system of the striatum (<a id="xref-ref-14-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-14">Daly &amp; Fredholm, 1998</a>). Blockade of adenosine receptors also reverses the inhibition of adrenaline release in the sympathetic nervous system and results in sympathetic stimulation (<a id="xref-ref-44-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-44">Kruger, 1996</a>).</p><p id="p-15">Elsewhere in the body, caffeine causes relaxation of smooth muscle (especially bronchial smooth muscle) and stimulation of cardiac muscle; these effects resemble those of &#x3B2;-adrenoceptor stimulation.

It relaxes the lower oesophageal sphincter and can predispose to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. It also causes gastric hypersecretion, which is associated with susceptibility to ulceration. It increases the rate of gastric emptying and the acidic gastric contents therefore pass more rapidly into the duodenum; this can lead to inflammation of the duodenal mucosa (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-6">Boekema <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>).</p><p id="p-18">The diuretic action of caffeine is well known.

The third study found no relationship on either scale between caffeine intake and anxiety, depression or total scores (<a id="xref-ref-50-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-50">Mayo <em>et al</em>, 1993</a>).</p><p id="p-35">In an experimental study, caffeine was administered intravenously to 13 patients with schizophrenia who had been caffeine free for 6 weeks (<a id="xref-ref-48-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-48">Lucas <em>et al</em>, 1990</a>). The dose used (10 mg/kg of body weight) was the equivalent of drinking seven cups of brewed coffee in a row. Caffeine increased both the total score and the unusual thoughts sub-scale score on the BPRS. Conversely, caffeine decreased withdrawal/retardation. Interestingly, this large dose did not increase anxiety scores. The results of this study are consistent with those of the clinical studies described above, but they need to be interpreted with caution because of the large dose and the lack of a control group of people without schizophrenia (<a id="xref-ref-36-4" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-36">Hughes <em>et al</em>, 1998</a>).</p></div><div id="sec-14" class="subsection"><h3>Psychiatric in-patients</h3><p id="p-39">Among adult psychiatric patients in the USA, a significant number have been found to use large amounts of caffeine (750 mg or more per day); such individuals have higher levels of both anxiety and depression than those who consume less (<a id="xref-ref-29-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-29">Greden <em>et al</em>, 1978</a>).

Assessment of caffeine intake should therefore form part of routine psychiatric assessment. This is particularly important in people with anxiety and sleep disorders, eating disorders and substance misuse. Assessment can easily be incorporated into the assessment of alcohol and drug use. In people who misuse drugs or have an eating disorder, it is appropriate to ask about use of over-the-counter products that contain caffeine. Intake should be quantified roughly in terms of the number of cups/mugs of tea or coffee and cans of carbonated drinks consumed in an average day. This can be converted into daily caffeine intake (Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>).

Other situations where caffeine intake may be relevant include poor response to hypnotics, recurrent headaches and palpitations (<a id="xref-ref-28-3" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#ref-28">Greden, 1974</a>). General practitioners, who see large numbers of patients with anxiety and sleep disorders, should also be made aware of the importance of caffeine and encouraged to ask about its use. Those who consume large amounts of caffeine should be given information about is effects and encouraged to reduce their intake.</p><p id="p-46">If overuse of caffeine is established, gradual reduction in intake or gradual substitution with caffeine-free alternatives is probably preferable to abrupt cessation. Decaffeinated coffee and tea are now readily available. Although there have been concerns about potential carcinogenic effects when beverages are decaffeinated chemically, processes that use water and carbon dioxide seem to be safe. Caffeine-free cola is also becoming more available. Those responsible for in-patient psychiatric units should be aware of the potential role of excessive caffeine consumption in exacerbating sleep problems and behavioural disturbance and should encourage patients to reduce their consumption. Decaffeinated beverages should be provided on psychiatric wards.</p><p id="p-47">Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/432#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> gives useful website addresses for further information on caffeine.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-16"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-1"><li id="list-item-1">

 <p id="p-1">Of the many interactions with psychotropic drugs, a minority are potentially hazardous. Most interactions are pharmacodynamic, resulting from augmented or antagonistic actions at a receptor or from different mechanisms in the same tissue. Most important pharmacokinetic interactions are due to effects on metabolism or renal excretion. The major enzymes involved in metabolism belong to the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system. Genetic variation in the CYP system produces people who are &#x2018;poor&#x2019;, &#x2018;extensive&#x2019; or &#x2018;ultra-rapid&#x2019; drug metabolisers. Hazardous interactions more often result from enzyme inhibition, but the probability of interaction depends on the initial level of enzyme activity and the availability of alternative metabolic routes for elimination of the drug. There is currently interest in interactions involving uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases and the P-glycoprotein cell transport system, but their importance for psychotropics has yet to be defined. The most serious interactions with psychotropics result in profound sedation, central nervous system toxicity, large changes in blood pressure, ventricular arrhythmias, an increased risk of dangerous side-effects or a decreased therapeutic effect of one of the interacting drugs.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">A drug interaction, defined as the modification of the action of one drug by another, can be beneficial or harmful, or it can have no significant effect. An appreciation of clinically important interactions is becoming increasingly necessary with the rising use of combinations of drugs in the management of chronic medical conditions. This trend is likely to increase as the population ages and treatments for a greater number of conditions are introduced into clinical practice. Interactions are a particular problem with elderly people, who, as well as being more likely to take several drugs concurrently, are at greater risk of an adverse drug interaction than younger people. This is because of effects of ageing on organs that deal with the metabolism and excretion of drugs, notably the liver and kidneys. Other vulnerable groups include polydrug misusers, psychiatric patients taking high doses of medication in the management of treatment-resistant disorders and people in developing countries in which there is a high prevalence of self-medication and irresponsible dispensing by a small minority of pharmacists (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-4">Edwards, 2004</a>). Adverse drug interactions can cause significant morbidity and mortality and, as a result of changes in prescribing habits, problems related to polypharmacy are likely to grow.</p><p id="p-3">There are numerous known and potential interactions with psychotropic drugs, and many of them do not have clinically significant consequences. Most clinically important interactions involve drugs that have a narrow therapeutic index (a small difference between the therapeutic and toxic concentrations), for example lithium, phenytoin and warfarin (Table 1<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#T2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a> and Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>). It is impossible to remember every potential interaction, or even those that are clinically significant. However, if the clinician has an understanding of the mechanisms underlying drug interactions, it is more likely that the possible consequences will be considered when selecting therapy.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Pharmacological and clinical considerations of psychotropic interactions</strong></h3>

 </div><p id="p-21">Drug interactions are usually classified as pharmaceutical, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (Table 1<a id="xref-table-wrap-2-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#T2"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>).</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Pharmaceutical interactions</h2><p id="p-22">Pharmaceutical interactions occur when drugs are mixed outside the body prior to administration. For example, mixing chemically incompatible drugs before intravenous infusion can result in precipitation or inactivation. An example is the incompatibility of phenobarbital with chlorpromazine or opioid analgesics when mixed in the same syringe. Of the three mechanisms, pharmaceutical interactions are least likely to cause problems in clinical practice, and there are no potentially hazardous interactions of this type with psychotropic drugs.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Pharmacodynamic interactions</h2><p id="p-23">The most common interactions encountered in clinical practice are pharmacodynamic. They occur when drugs compete for the same receptor or produce antagonistic or synergistic effects on the same target organ or system. Many instances of antagonism are beneficial: for example, naloxone is a specific antagonist that reverses the action of morphine by competing with it for occupancy of the opioid <em>&#x3BC;</em>receptor. By contrast, antipsychotic drugs reduce the efficacy of levodopa in Parkinson&#x2019;s disease by blockade of dopamine receptors in the corpus striatum.</p><p id="p-24">Synergistic interactions may be used therapeutically, for example in augmentation treatment of resistant depression with lithium and an anti-depressant, but often they are adverse. A common result is toxicity of the central nervous system (CNS) and hypertension or hypotension, which is discussed in more detail below, in the subsection &#x2018;Effects on the central nervous system&#x2019;. Depression of the CNS can also occur when alcohol and tricyclic antidepressants are taken concomitantly. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding when taken with aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, because of a synergistic inhibition of platelet aggregation.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Pharmacokinetic interactions</h2><p id="p-25">Pharmacokinetic interactions occur when the absorption, distribution or elimination of one drug is influenced by another.</p><div id="sec-4" class="subsection"><h3>Absorption</h3><p id="p-26">Important clinical effects caused by changes in drug absorption are rarely seen in general medical or psychiatric practice. These interactions usually result from the binding of two drugs in the gut, preventing their absorption. This property is used therapeutically when activated charcoal is given following an overdose of tricyclic antidepressants. Charcoal adsorbs the drug in the gut, and thereby attenuates the effects of the overdose. An example of an undesirable interaction is the decreased absorption of phenothiazines or sulpiride when they are taken concurrently with antacids, leading to a reduced antipsychotic effect.</p><p id="p-27">One drug may alter the rate of absorption of another. When paracetamol is taken with metoclopramide, the more rapid gastric emptying decreases the time to absorption. Conversely, drugs with antimuscarinic activity, such as tricyclic anti-depressants, delay gastric emptying and thus the rate of absorption of co-prescribed medication. However, for most drugs, other than analgesics, the rate of absorption is not critical to their efficacy.</p></div><div id="sec-9" class="subsection"><h3>Metabolism</h3><p id="p-31">Interactions involving drug metabolism are being increasingly well characterised. Induction of enzymes involved in drug metabolism results in reduced plasma concentrations of drugs that are substrates for the enzyme, and therefore their effectiveness is decreased. For example, enzyme induction by carbamazepine decreases the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotics. However, enzyme induction does not usually cause clinically hazardous interactions. Most significant drug interactions involve inhibition of enzyme systems, which increases plasma concentrations of the drugs involved, in turn leading to an increased risk of toxic effects.</p><p id="p-32">The most important enzymes involved in drug interactions are members of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system that are responsible for many of the phase 1 biotransformations of drugs. These metabolic transformations, such as oxidation, reduction and hydrolysis, produce a molecule that is suitable for conjugation. The potential for interactions involving uridine diphosphate glucurono-syltransferases (UGTs), responsible for phase 2 conjugation reactions, is now recognised. These reactions involve formation of a covalent bond between the drug and an endogenous substrate such as glucuronide, enabling the compound to be eliminated from the body usually by the kidney or in the bile.</p><p id="p-33">Many psychotropic drugs have a high affinity for one or more of the enzymes in the CYP or UGT systems, which play a major role in their metabolism. Induction and inhibition of the activity of drug-metabolising enzymes, and the potential to precipitate hazardous drug interactions, are considered below, in the section &#x2018;Interactions involving drug-metabolising enzymes&#x2019;.</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-12"><h2>Interactions involving drug-metabolising enzymes</h2><p id="p-36">Many drugs have a lipophilic structure that facilitates their passage through cell membranes to their sites of action. However, lipophilic molecules are less readily excreted from the body and they are usually metabolised to hydrophilic derivatives, which are more easily eliminated.</p><div id="sec-13" class="subsection"><h3>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes</h3><p id="p-37">A system to standardise the nomenclature of the CYP system was adopted in 1996 (<a id="xref-ref-11-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-11">Nelson <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>). The three characters that follow the CYP abbreviation (for example in CYP2A6) represent the family, subfamily and individual enzyme, respectively. Families of enzymes share more than 40% homology in their gene sequences (in this example the family is represented by the number 2). Subfamilies share more than 55% homology in their gene sequences (in this example represented by the letter A).</p><p id="p-38">Eleven CYP enzymes are responsible for metabolising the majority of pharmacological agents. Those of importance in the metabolism of psychotropic drugs are CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, the last being responsible for the metabolism of more than 90% of psychotropic drugs that undergo hepatic biotransformation. Some key features of CYP enzymes are outlined in Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-2"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 2</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes: key points</strong></h3>

 </div><div id="sec-18" class="subsection"><h4>CYP enzyme induction and inhibition</h4><p id="p-51">CYP enzymes can be induced or inhibited by drugs or other biological substances, with a consequent change in their ability to metabolise drugs that are normally substrates for those enzymes. However, exposure to an enzyme inducer or inhibitor does not always result in altered responses to co-prescribed drugs that are potentially subject to interactions. The probability of a clinically important interaction with co-prescribed drugs is unpredictable in individuals. For example, an enzyme inhibitor is more likely to have a greater effect if the person is an ultra-rapid metaboliser and will have little effect in someone who is already a poor metaboliser. Many drugs are metabolised by several CYP enzymes, so the probability of an interaction will depend on the enzyme(s) affected by the inducer or inhibitor and the availability of an effective alternative route of metabolism in that individual.</p><div id="sec-19" class="subsection"><h5>Induction</h5><p id="p-52">CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzymes are capable of being induced, resulting in increased quantities of enzyme as well as increased enzyme activity. Any drug that is a substrate of that enzyme will be more rapidly metabolised and this may result in reduced efficacy. As with ultra-rapid metabolisers, a pro-drug may be activated sufficiently rapidly to produce toxic levels of the active derivative. The onset and offset of enzyme induction take place gradually, usually over 7&#x2013;10 days, and both the rate and extent can be difficult to predict (<a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-2">Cupp &amp; Tracy, 1997</a>). The slow onset is due to the time taken for the inducing agent to accumulate and the time needed to synthesise the new enzyme. The slow offset depends on the elimination of the inducing agent and the decay of the increased enzyme levels.</p><p id="p-53">Inducers of the CYP system are less numerous than inhibitors. The most important are inducers of CYP3A4 and include carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, rifampicin and St John&#x2019;s wort (<em>Hypericum perforatum</em>). An example of an interaction in psychiatric practice is the reduced efficacy of haloperidol when carbamazepine is started, resulting from induction of CYP3A4.</p></div><div id="sec-20" class="subsection"><h5>Inhibition</h5><p id="p-54">Inhibition of CYP enzymes is the most common mechanism that produces serious and potentially life-threatening drug interactions (<a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-6">Johnson <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). Most enzyme inhibitors act specifically on individual CYP enzymes, so a drug inhibiting CYP2A6 may have no effect on CYP2C19.</p><p id="p-55">Inhibition is usually due to a competitive action at the enzyme&#x2019;s binding site. Therefore, in contrast to enzyme induction, the onset and offset of inhibition are dependent on the plasma level (and therefore the plasma half-life) of the inhibiting drug. Thus, drugs with a short half-life such as cimetidine will cause rapid inhibition, but the effects will be short-lived after it has been stopped. Important inhibitors of CYP that are involved in psychotropic drug interactions are listed in Table 2<a id="xref-table-wrap-3-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#T3"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>. An example of this type of interaction is the increased risk of serious skin reactions with lamotrigine when it is co-prescribed with sodium valproate, resulting from inhibition of CYP3A4.</p><p id="p-56">Rarely, the inhibition is non-competitive and the inhibiting drug binds irreversibly to the CYP enzyme, forming an inactive complex. This happens, for example, with erythromycin. The offset of inhibition is slow since new enzyme must be synthesised to replace the inactive complexes.</p></div></div></div><div id="sec-22" class="subsection"><h3>P-glycoprotein</h3><p id="p-58">P-glycoprotein is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily. It is an efflux pump capable of transporting a wide range of compounds from the intracellular space into the extracellular matrix. It is present in tissues throughout the human body, such as the intestinal wall, liver, kidneys and cerebral microvascular endothelium, and it plays a significant role in drug absorption, distribution and elimination.</p><p id="p-59">Intestinal P-glycoprotein reduces effective drug absorption by actively transporting drugs back into the intestinal lumen. P-glycoprotein in the liver and kidneys promotes excretion of drugs from the blood stream into the bile and urine, respectively. In addition, P-glycoprotein is present at the blood&#x2013;brain barrier, where it reduces drug access to the CNS.</p><p id="p-60">Like CYP enzymes, P-glycoprotein can be induced and inhibited by other drugs (Table 3<a id="xref-table-wrap-4-2" class="xref-up-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#T4"><span>&#x21D1;</span></a>), which creates the potential for drug interactions (<a id="xref-ref-8-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-8">Kim, 2002</a>). This is best illustrated by loperamide, an opioid derivative that normally does not cause central effects, owing to its exclusion at the blood&#x2013;brain barrier. However, if it is co-administered with quinidine, an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein, it causes CNS side-effects. In animal models, the CNS concentrations of certain drugs increase by 10- to 100-fold when P-glycoprotein is inhibited (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-9">Lin &amp; Yamazaki, 2003</a>). The role of P-glycoprotein in mediating drug interactions with psychotropic drugs is only starting to be unravelled (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/440#ref-1">Carson <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>).</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-33"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p id="p-113">Much research has been carried out into potentially hazardous interactions with psychotropic drugs, yet there is much that remains unknown. The evidence for some potential interactions is based on animal experiments, isolated case reports in which there is doubt about the cause-and-effect relationships, or small-scale volunteer studies that may not reflect the action of, and interaction between, drugs in patients. Other possible interactions are deduced from the occurrence of interactions during treatment with related compounds. There is also a lack of knowledge of the size of the problem and of the many pharmacological and host factors that determine whether or not an individual will have a particular interaction. Despite these gaps in our knowledge, there is now sufficient understanding to help prevent a number of serious and potentially fatal interactions. Particularly important is an awareness of the role of modulation of the activity of CYP enzymes in mediating drug interactions.</p><p id="p-114">Preventive measures include avoidance of unnecessary or unthoughtful polypharmacy, an understanding of the predictors of severe interactions (for example, older age, impaired hepatic and renal function, and multiple substance misuse), better education of prescribers and pharmacists about known and potential interactions, and improved drug safety monitoring directed towards the discovery of new interactions.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-34"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-10"><li id="list-item-50">

 <p id="p-1">Pathological gambling has so far received scant attention in the psychiatric literature. It has a prevalence rate of about 1% in most countries, and with the deregulation of gambling in the UK the prevalence is set to rise here. Pathological gambling can adversely affect the individual, family and society, and also carries high rates of psychiatric comorbidity. Early identification and appropriate treatment can limit the long-term adverse consequences and improve outcome. This article reviews assessment techniques and tools, and treatment strategies for pathological gambling.</p>
 </div><p id="p-2">Gambling is a common, socially acceptable and legal leisure activity in most cultures across the world. It involves wagering something of value (usually money) on a game or event whose outcome is unpredictable and determined by chance (<a id="xref-ref-23-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-23">Ladouceur <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>). The various types of gambling activities commonly available in the UK are the national lottery, scratch cards, internet gambling, casino games, sports betting, bingo, slot machines and private betting. Results from the most recent British Gambling Prevalence Survey indicate that nearly three-quarters of the adult population had gambled in the previous year and that over half had gambled in the previous week (<a id="xref-ref-34-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-34">Sproston <em>et al</em>, 2000</a>). For the large majority, gambling is a recreational activity with no adverse consequences. However, for a significant minority it progresses to pathological gambling, defined in the DSM&#x2013;IV as &#x2018;a persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour that disrupts personal, family or vocational pursuits&#x2019; (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-1">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</a>).</p><p id="p-3">The wide array of choices available to the modern-day gambler, combined with the deregulation of gambling in the UK, is likely to result in an increase in the number of pathological gamblers and gambling-related problems (<a id="xref-ref-12-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-12">Griffiths, 2004</a>). As it is an important public health issue, associated with high rates of psychiatric comorbidity and wide-ranging personal, family and societal problems, it is crucial that mental health professionals become familiar with this disorder, its assessment and treatment.</p><div class="section" id="sec-1"><h2>Epidemiology</h2><p id="p-4">Pathological gambling typically begins in early adolescence in males (later in females) and runs a chronic, progressive course, punctuated by periods of abstinence and relapses. Although gambling is currently more common among men, the prevalence among women is on the increase. Women are usually older than men when they take up gambling , but once started they develop gambling-related problems more rapidly. In a meta-analysis of 119 prevalence studies, <a id="xref-ref-32-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-32">Shaffer <em>et al</em>(1999)</a> found the lifetime and past-year prevalence rates of pathological gambling in adults to be 1.6% and 1.14%, respectively (adolescents had prevalence rates of 5.77% and 3.88%, respectively). The British Gambling Prevalence Survey (<a id="xref-ref-34-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-34">Sproston <em>et al</em>, 2000</a>) estimated the prevalence of problem gambling in British adults to be 0.8%, and this is likely to increase in the coming years. It is important to note that the prevalence of pathological gambling in psychiatric patients ranges from 6 to 12%.</p><p id="p-5">Adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to gambling and gambling-related problems. Although gambling is illegal for people under 18 years old, surveys have found that nearly three-quarters of adolescents had gambled in the previous year and that rates of problem and pathological gambling in adolescents were nearly twice those in adults. Gambling in this group is strongly associated with alcohol and drug misuse and with depression, and there is some evidence linking early onset of gambling to more severe later gambling and more negative consequences. Other at-risk populations include minority ethnic groups, those from lower socio-economic groups, and those with mental health or substance misuse problems.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-2"><h2>Adverse consequences</h2><p id="p-6">Pathological gambling adversely affects the individual, the family and society. It can negatively influence the gambler&#x2019;s physical and mental health. Gamblers have been noted to report high rates of various psychosomatic disorders and psychiatric problems such as affective, anxiety, substance misuse and personality disorders. Excessive gambling can have a significant impact on the individual&#x2019;s financial situation, often resulting in large debts, poverty and even bankruptcy. To fund their gambling, some resort to criminal activities, ranging from theft and prostitution to violent crime, with obvious legal consequences. Gambling can also adversely affect the gambler&#x2019;s interpersonal relationships and can result in relationship problems, neglect of the family, domestic violence and child abuse (<a id="xref-ref-15-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-15">Jacobs <em>et al</em>, 1989</a>). Children of pathological gamblers have been found to be at increased risk of behavioural problems, depression and substance misuse (<a id="xref-ref-29-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-29">Raylu &amp; Oei, 2001</a>). Costs of gambling borne by society include the cost of the crimes committed by gamblers and the various health and social care costs.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-3"><h2>Psychiatric comorbidity</h2><p id="p-7">Research has consistently noted the very high rates of Axis I and Axis II comorbidity in pathological gamblers. People with problem or pathological gambling were many times more likely than the general population to report major psychiatric disorders: major depression, antisocial personality disorder, phobias and current or past history of alcohol misuse (<a id="xref-ref-7-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-7">Cunningham-Williams <em>et al,</em> 1998</a>). Depression is probably the most common psychiatric disorder comorbid with pathological gambling. Prevalence figures quoted range from 50 to 75% (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-3">Becona <em>et al</em>, 1996</a>). Two theories have been put forward to explain the relationship between gambling and depression. One is that gambling-related losses and other adverse consequences result in depression. The second is that gambling is an activity engaged in to alleviate a depressed state &#x2013; it is used as an &#x2018;antidepressant&#x2019;.</p><p id="p-8">Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and completed suicides are much more common in pathological gamblers than in the general population. The rate of suicidal ideation in pathological gamblers has been estimated to range from 20 to 80% and that of suicide attempts from 4 to 40%. Severe gambling, large debts, coexisting psychiatric disorders and substance use have all been associated with an increased suicide risk.</p><p id="p-9"><a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-4">Black &amp; Moyer (1998)</a>, in a study of 30 pathological gamblers, found that 64% had a lifetime diagnosis of substance misuse. In a retrospective chart review of 113 pathological gamblers, <a id="xref-ref-17-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-17">Kausch (2003)</a> noted that 66.4% had a lifetime diagnosis of substance misuse or dependence. Other disorders commonly comorbid with pathological gambling are personality disorders, impulse-control disorders, anxiety disorders and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. For an excellent overview of psychiatric comorbidity in pathological gamblers see <a id="xref-ref-6-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-6">Crockford &amp; El-Guebaly (1998)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-4"><h2>The assessment</h2><p id="p-10">A good assessment will help the clinician to formulate a comprehensive and effective treatment plan. The key areas to be explored are summarised in Box 1<a id="xref-boxed-text-1-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#boxed-text-1"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>. Many gamblers feel ashamed and embarrassed to reveal the true extent of their problems. Hence, the clinician needs to be sensitive and tactful in exploring the individual&#x2019;s gambling behaviour. Sometimes, it might even be appropriate to obtain collateral information from the patient&#x2019;s partner, spouse or friends (with consent from the patient). It is good to ask the patient to describe in his or her own words the initiation, development and progression of the gambling behaviour in a chronological sequence. The key DSM&#x2013;IV diagnostic criteria for pathological gambling include preoccupation with gambling, tolerance (the need to wager increasing amounts to achieve excitement), inability to control or stop gambling and &#x2018;chasing&#x2019; one&#x2019;s losses, all of which adversely affect the individual&#x2019;s interpersonal, social and occupational functioning. Features of tolerance, craving, withdrawal symptoms and other diagnostic criteria, if present, will readily confirm the diagnosis, but this forms only part of the assessment.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-1"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 1</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Summary of key aspects of assessment of the pathological gambler</strong></h3>

 </li></ul>
 </div><p id="p-27">As maintaining factors can often inform specific interventions, it is important to ask &#x2018;What are the reasons why you gamble?&#x2019; Most commonly reported maintaining factors include negative mood state, boredom and the need to overcome financial problems.</p><p id="p-28">Previous attempts to cut back or quit gambling and treatments tried should inform the clinician in planning the current treatment type and setting. A sensitive exploration of the individual&#x2019;s financial situation (personal and family income and financial stability) and financial problems (gambling debts, bankruptcy) will guide the clinician in suggesting feasible and realistic solutions. The clinician must evaluate the impact of gambling on work (being late, absences, job losses, etc.) and interpersonal and marital life (strained relationships, neglect of family, domestic violence, etc.).</p><p id="p-29">An understanding of a gambler&#x2019;s reasons for consultation will provide indicators of motivation to engage in treatment. A useful question to ask is &#x2018;Why are you seeking treatment now?&#x2019; The person should also be specifically asked about his or her expectations of treatment, in terms of its type, duration and setting.</p><p id="p-30">Despite the high rates of psychiatric comorbidity in pathological gamblers, they often go unrecognised and untreated. A detailed psychiatric history-taking and mental state examination should establish whether there is comorbidity. Gamblers should also be asked about their use/misuse of psychoactive substances and, even more important, their use of alcohol and drugs during gambling sessions.</p><p id="p-31">Assessment of suicide risk (past attempts at self-harm and ongoing suicidal thoughts and plans) forms a crucial part of the overall assessment.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-5"><h2>Assessment instruments</h2><p id="p-32">In addition to the clinical interview, several structured instruments have been developed for the screening, diagnosis and assessment of the severity of pathological gambling. The most commonly used of these are listed in Box 2<a id="xref-boxed-text-2-1" class="xref-down-link" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#boxed-text-2"><span>&#x21D3;</span></a>. More recently, many tools have been developed that attempt to assess gambling-related attitudes, beliefs, cognitions and urges. These are useful in formulating specific treatments and in monitoring response to treatment.</p><div class="boxed-text" id="boxed-text-2"><span class="boxed-text-label"><strong>Box 2</strong> </span> <h3><strong>Commonly used screening, assessment and diagnostic instruments</strong></h3>
 
 </div><p id="p-40">The clinician has a wide range of instruments to choose from, and the choice should be informed by the population sample, purpose of assessment and the instrument&#x2019;s psychometric properties. It may also be reasonable to use a combination of instruments to capture the complex, multidimensional aspects of gambling.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-6"><h2>Aetiology</h2><p id="p-41">A detailed discussion of the various aetiological models of pathological gambling is beyond the scope of this article. Various theories have been postulated: psychoanalytic (unconscious desire to lose, unresolved Oedipial conflicts), learning theories (monetary gain and excitement acting as positive reinforcers), cognitive theories (cognitive distortions such as magnification of one&#x2019;s gambling skills, superstitious beliefs, interpretive biases) and neurotransmitter theories (serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine dysfunction). To date, no single model fully explains the complex and heterogeneous nature of pathological gambling. The currently preferred approach to its aetiological understanding is eclectic, viewing pathological gambling as the result of a complex interaction between psychological, behavioural, cognitive and biological variables.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-7"><h2>Pharmacological interventions</h2><div id="sec-8" class="subsection"><h3>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors</h3><p id="p-42">Conceptualising pathological gambling as either an impulse-control disorder or an obsessive&#x2013;compulsive-spectrum disorder implicates the serotonergic system in its aetiology. There is also considerable neurobiological evidence to support serotonin (5-HT) system dysfunction in pathological gambling. Hence, fluvoxamine, citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline and fluvoxetine have all been tried with some success in treatment trials for pathological gamblers.</p><p id="p-43"><a id="xref-ref-13-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-13">Hollander <em>et al</em>(2000)</a>, in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of the use of fluvoxamine (mean dose 195 mg/day) with 15 pathological gamblers, noted significant improvements in the treatment group. However, this study had a small sample size (5 of the 15 dropped out) and was of relatively short duration (16 weeks). However, <a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-5">Blanco <em>et al</em>(2002)</a>, in a larger and longer study (32 gamblers, 6 months), failed to demonstrate any significant superiority of fluvoxamine over placebo. They also noted a high placebo response rate (59%).</p><p id="p-44">In a study of 53 pathological gamblers, <a id="xref-ref-20-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-20">Kim <em>et al</em>(2002)</a> noted paroxetine to be superior to placebo.</p><p id="p-45">An open-label trial of citalopram with 15 pathological gamblers found considerable improvements on various gambling measures in 87% of participants (<a id="xref-ref-38-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-38">Zimmerman <em>et al</em>, 2002</a>). The therapeutic gains usually occurred in the first few weeks of treatment and were sustained at 12 weeks; they were also found to be independent of the drug&#x2019;s antidepressant effects.</p><p id="p-46">Sertraline was no better than placebo in the treatment of pathological gambling in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 60 individuals (<a id="xref-ref-30-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-30">Saiz-Ruiz <em>et al</em>, 2005</a>).</p></div></div><div class="section" id="sec-13"><h2>Psychological interventions</h2><div id="sec-14" class="subsection"><h3>Behavioural treatments</h3><p id="p-53">Behavioural theorists view gambling as a learned maladaptive behaviour that can be unlearned through behavioural treatments derived from both classical and operant learning theories.</p><p id="p-54">Much of the early work (in the 1960s) on evaluating behavioural treatments for pathological gambling focused on aversion therapy, which is no longer used. <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-2">Barker &amp; Miller (1966)</a> were the first to report the successful use of electrical aversion therapy in a pathological gambler. <a id="xref-ref-31-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-31">Seager (1970)</a> found that 5 out of 14 gamblers were abstinent for 1&#x2013;3 years after aversion treatment. <a id="xref-ref-21-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-21">Koller (1972)</a> reported significant improvement in gambling behaviour in 8 out of 12 individuals given aversion treatment. However, some participants in the study also received other interventions, such as attending Gamblers Anonymous.</p><p id="p-55">Other behavioural treatments that have been used successfully include imaginal desensitisation, imaginal relaxation, behavioural monitoring, covert sensitisation and spousal contingency contracting.</p><p id="p-56"><a id="xref-ref-25-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-25">McConaghy <em>et al</em>(1983)</a> compared aversion therapy and imaginal desensitisation in 20 pathological gamblers and demonstrated both treatments to be effective. They also noted that the imaginal desensitisation group had significantly lower levels of state and trait anxiety, and fewer gambling behaviours and urges at 1-year follow-up, compared with the aversion therapy group.</p><p id="p-57">In a much larger study (<em>n</em> = 120), <a id="xref-ref-26-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-26">McConaghy <em>et al</em>(1991)</a> compared four behavioural treatments &#x2013;aversion therapy, imaginal desensitisation, imaginal relaxation and <em>in vivo</em> desensitisation &#x2013; and found patients receiving imaginal desensitisation to have the best outcome. This study had a relatively long-term follow-up (5.5 years), but the drop-out rate was very high (nearly 50%).</p><p id="p-58">Although a range of behavioural treatments have been found to be effective in the treatment of pathological gambling, these days behavioural therapy is more often administered in conjunction with cognitive treatment, as a cognitive&#x2013;behavioural treatment package.</p></div><div id="sec-16" class="subsection"><h3>Cognitive&#x2013;behavioural treatments</h3><p id="p-62">These treatments combine cognitive and behavioural aspects and attempt to alter gamblers&#x2019; cognitions and behaviours. <a id="xref-ref-33-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-33">Sharpe &amp; Tarrier (1993)</a> developed a cognitive&#x2013;behavioural approach that involves identifying high-risk situations (through functional analysis) or internal and external triggers that lead to urges to gamble and then working on effective coping strategies.

Specific cognitive&#x2013;behavioural treatment models have been developed and evaluated by <a id="xref-ref-28-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-28">Petry (2002)</a> and <a id="xref-ref-23-2" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-23">Ladouceur <em>et al</em>(2002)</a>.</p><p id="p-63"><a id="xref-ref-36-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-36">Sylvain <em>et al</em>(1997)</a> evaluated the efficacy of cognitive&#x2013;behavioural treatment in a sample of 29 male pathological gamblers.

At 12-month follow-up, the rates of abstinence or minimal gambling were 69% for the individual treatment arm, 35% for the group treatment and 35% for the combined treatment. The same research group also evaluated the efficacy of providing a relapse prevention treatment after a 6-week individual intervention (<a id="xref-ref-9-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/450#ref-9">Echeburua <em>et al,</em> 2000</a>).

With the deregulation of gambling in the UK, the prevalence of pathological gambling is likely to increase in the coming years. It is important to conceptualise pathological gambling as a heterogeneous entity, developed and maintained by a complex interplay of various biological, psychological and social variables. Preliminary research findings offer promising trends in pharmacological and cognitive&#x2013;behavioural treatments. Improved awareness among health professionals of problem gambling can lead to early recognition and treatment, thus limiting the more severe adverse consequences. Gambling behaviour should therefore be routinely enquired about as part of all psychiatric assessments. Further research is needed to better understand the aetiological mechanisms that would inform effective treatment interventions for this disorder.</p></div><div class="section" id="sec-20"><h2>MCQs</h2><ol class="list-ord" id="list-4"><li id="list-item-20">

responses to a postal questionnaire sent to consultants in adult general psychiatry in the UK. The aim was to study their understanding, recognition and management of ill health in patients with severe mental illness. The 300 responses (72% response rate) received have been helpful in revealing the present state of practice in recognising the problems and addressing the unmet health needs of this patient group.</p><p id="p-2">Only 72% of the consultants who responded thought that patients have a complete physical examination on admission to an acute psychiatric ward; 28% believed that patients do not have a full physical examination within 72 h of admission.</p><p id="p-3">As regards out-patients, 26% of consultants believed that the medical needs of their patients are managed by general practitioners (GPs) via care coordinators. Only 45 % reported that their patients had been asked to have physical check-ups at GP surgeries in the previous 3 years. The rest did not know whether their patients have any medical needs nor whether their needs are addressed at primary care level.</p><p id="p-4">Fifty-six per cent of respondents felt that the physical health of out-patients, albeit important, is the responsibility of primary care. As psychiatrists, they did not get involved in investigating possible medical conditions of their patients and they did not expect to receive information from primary care. Of the 44% who thought they should be involved in their patients&#x2019; well-being, 51% reported that they have minimal time or resources to deal with physical health questions; 45% said that they have moderate resources and could mobilise these if the need arose; only 4% reported that they have provisions to address the physical needs of their patients.</p><p id="p-5">I therefore welcome recent articles in <em>APT</em> focusing on the physical health and lifestyle of people with severe mental illness and problems of their management (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.1#ref-1">Connolly &amp; Kelly, 2005</a>; <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.1#ref-2">Garden, 2005</a>; <a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.1#ref-3">Lester, 2005</a>). It is important to draw colleagues&#x2019; attention to (belated) protocols of shared care for people with long-standing mental health problems.</p><p id="p-6">Training for all mental health professionals working with people with severe mental illness and the increased drug-related risk of weight gain, hypercholesterolaemia, hyperprolactinaemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and other conditions affecting patients will need to come to the forefront of concerns when assessing the quality of mental health provision for this patient group.</p></div></div><hr class="rdb-page-break" /><div><div class="article fulltext-view"><p id="p-1">We read with interest the comprehensive article on lifestyle and physical health in schizophrenia by <a id="xref-ref-2-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.2#ref-2">Connolly &amp; Kelly (2005)</a>. Physical health problems in chronic mental illness are recognised causes of morbidity and mortality (<a id="xref-ref-1-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.2#ref-1">Brown <em>et al</em>, 1999</a>). Previous studies have reported a very high prevalence of smoking (75&#x2013;92%) in people with psychotic disorders (<a id="xref-ref-5-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.2#ref-5">Kelly &amp; McCreadie, 2000</a>).</p><p id="p-2">In a survey of two long-stay psychiatric rehabilitation wards in Lincoln, 31 patients (21 men, 10 women; mean age = 43 years; s.d. = 10; 27/31 with a diagnosis of schizophrenia) were asked to complete the short version of Fagerstrom questionnaire (<a id="xref-ref-4-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.2#ref-4">Heatherton <em>et al</em>, 1991</a>). This is a highly reliable and valid questionnaire widely used to measure levels of nicotine dependence. The higher the score, the greater the likelihood of dependence and of benefit from nicotine replacement therapy.</p><p id="p-3">Of the 31 participants, 24 (77.4%) were smokers, more than half of whom were either highly or very highly dependent on nicotine (11.5% very highly dependent, 42% highly dependent, 11.5 % moderately and 12.4% mildly dependent). About two-thirds (62%) of the participants were overweight and one-third had comorbid physical illnesses such as diabetes, asthma or thyroid disorder.</p><p id="p-4">Reducing smoking rates in people with schizophrenia, together with better management of physical illness, are suggested strategies to reduce high mortality rates (<a id="xref-ref-3-1" class="xref-bibr" href="http://apt.rcpsych.org/content/11/6/457.2#ref-3">Cormac <em>et al</em>, 2005</a>). By adopting a shared care model, mental health professionals with the help of primary care services could effectively address the problem of unhealthy life styles in people with mental illness.</p><p id="p-5">Sports facilities should be available to engage patients in physical activities. Dietary advice by a hospital nutritionist and provision of a healthy diet would be extremely useful in improving the physical health of the long-stay patients. In addition, nicotine dependence can be tackled through liaison with primary care teams offering education, support and nicotine replacement therapy.</p></div></div><hr class="rdb-page-break" /><div><div class="article fulltext-view"><p id="p-1">Patel, M.
