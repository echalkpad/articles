 <p>While the programming world is full of sophisticated IDEs and text editors that are easy to use. Lot of people including myself still prefer the command-line as their main programming environment. And that&#x2019;s for a good reason. I think there are a couple of concepts that make the command-line a powerful development environment:</p>

<ul>
 <li>
 <p>Composition: This is the heart of UNIX, composing small programs that do one thing well together to form a bigger one, similar to connecting Lego blocks.<br>
While there is a learning curve of getting used with different commands, the big advantages of the composition philosophy are flexibility and consistency. For a person who spend most of his time writing code, compromising a learning curve for flexibility is a rewarding choice. You&#x2019;ll eventually be a winner since you won&#x2019;t have to fight against a typical IDE monster to accomplish a behavior that is not shipped by default. And most importantly, you won&#x2019;t have to learn/install a new environment by language. This is what I mean by consistency, you won&#x2019;t have to learn how to perform a recursive regex search for each IDE you manipulate. A grep is a grep wherever you are.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 <p>Extensibility: This is another source of power and a consequence of a simple composition protocol (&#x201C;Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface&#x201D;). If you want to add a custom tool to your toolkit, just build it. The simple communication protocol make it quite easy to compose a new program with the rest of programs, using any language, and any library. You don&#x2019;t have to stick with language X just because you&#x2019;re using an X IDE. Take this opportunity to learn a new language and effectively employ it.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 <p>Keyboard Instead of Mouse(or typing rather than selecting): Getting used to Mouse-free development for programs/tools that you frequently use takes time but increases productivity. This is not as a strong point as the previous ones, but it&#x2019;s worth mentioning.</p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>The command-line gives you power with a cost. For a person who use his computer as a music player, this power is not needed. But for a programmer, it&#x2019;s certainly a good thing.</p>

<p>Now why the command-line is not the main choice among developers? Personally, I think it&#x2019;s because it&#x2019;s not easy to use(<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy">in contrast with simple</a>) and lacks some important features, in contrast with other modern IDEs and text editors(Atom,sublime&#x2026;). The good thing is that these issues are not fundamental ones but can be resolved. We just need to reinvent the command-line to be a framework of development rather than just an input/output system. featuring an extensible ground for customization and extensibility, a good command autocomplete system, real-time check (and evaluation), modern interface(supporting more colors), built-in panes, A help (extract -&gt; tar -xvzf), an intuitive shortcuts system, a package manager etc&#x2026;
The text editor will be just a tool in the box with one responsibility of editing files. File navigation, Find/Replace, panes etc&#x2026; are handled by other programs.</p>
