 <p>Want to get started with some command-line tools on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X? This tutorial covers installing Xcode/<span class="caps">CLT</span>, Homebrew, and other useful initial&#xA0;configuration.</p>

<p>If you prefer to be in control of when updates are downloaded and installed, open System Preferences, go to the App Store preference pane, and uncheck all the&#xA0;boxes.</p>
<h2 id="unhide-the-library-folder">Unhide the Library&#xA0;folder</h2>
<p>Just like the last few releases, Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X now hides the <code>~/Library</code> folder by default, but on Yosemite and Mavericks it is now easier to make it visible&#xA0;again.</p>
<p>With the Finder as the foremost application, press shift-command-H and then command-J, which will bring up a window that configures Finder view options. Check the &#x201C;Show Library Folder&#x201D; and close the window. Thanks to the Apple engineers that made this process more&#xA0;user-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="bash-profile-setup">Bash profile&#xA0;setup</h2>
<p>Since Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X is a full 64-bit system, we&#x2019;ll save some headaches by letting our compiler know that all compilation should assume 64 bits. Also, since Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X&#x2019;s default <code>PATH</code> is <code>/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin</code>, we&#x2019;ll want to change it so that certain Homebrew installations (e.g., <a href="http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">Python</a>) will take precedence over stock <span class="caps">OS</span> X binaries. To make these changes, open <code>~/.bash_profile</code> &#x2026;</p>



<p>&#x2026; and&#xA0;add:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c"># Set architecture flags</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">ARCHFLAGS</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"-arch x86_64"</span>
<span class="c"># Ensure user-installed binaries take precedence</span>
<span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">=</span>/usr/local/bin:<span class="nv">$PATH</span>
<span class="c"># Load .bashrc if it exists</span>
<span class="nb">test</span> -f ~/.bashrc <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">source</span> ~/.bashrc
</pre></div>


<p>Since the above directives will take effect on the next login, let&#x2019;s go ahead and source the file to ensure it takes effect for the current&#xA0;session:</p>



<p>With those first steps out of the way, now it&#x2019;s time to get the necessary compilation tools in&#xA0;place.</p>


<h2 id="compiler">Compiler</h2>
<p>Installing development-related software in the past has required the compiler tool-chain that comes with Xcode. Thankfully, if you don&#x2019;t need or want Xcode, those compiler tools are now available separately, saving download time and about four gigabytes of disk&#xA0;space.</p>
<p>Alternatively, there are some reasons you might want the full version of&#xA0;Xcode:</p>
<ul>
<li>To compile the few tools that won&#x2019;t compile without the full version of&#xA0;Xcode</li>
<li>To download and manually compile open-source Mac&#xA0;applications</li>
<li>To develop your own Mac/iOS&#xA0;applications</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you&#x2019;ve decided whether you need Xcode or not, run the following command in the&#xA0;Terminal:</p>



<p>You will then be asked whether you want to install Xcode or the command line developer tools, with the latter being the default. Once you&#x2019;ve installed one or the other, you can proceed to installing&#xA0;Homebrew.</p>
<h2 id="homebrew">Homebrew</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need cross-platform software &#x2014; usually without a <span class="caps">GUI</span> and accessible only via the command line &#x2014; that isn&#x2019;t readily available via the Mac App Store. <a href="https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/">Homebrew</a> provides an easy way to install these packages, so let&#x2019;s fire up Terminal.app and install&#xA0;it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>ruby -e <span class="s2">"</span><span class="k">$(</span>curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install<span class="k">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Follow the prompts to download and install Homebrew, entering your administrative password when prompted. Then run the following command to ensure that there aren&#x2019;t any potential problems with your environment. Some warnings (if any) are informational and not necessary actionable; it&#x2019;s just a good idea to at least read through and see if anything looks out of the&#xA0;ordinary.</p>



<p>The following command will update to the latest version of Homebrew and its&#xA0;formulae:</p>



<p>Let&#x2019;s use Homebrew to install some packages that I often find&#xA0;useful:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>brew install bash-completion ssh-copy-id wget
</pre></div>


<p>You can run <code>brew info ssh-copy-id</code>, for example, if you want to know what those packages&#xA0;do.</p>
<p>Some Homebrew formulae recommend post-installation steps. For example, to activate bash completion, add the following to your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="o">[</span> -f <span class="k">$(</span>brew --prefix<span class="k">)</span>/etc/bash_completion <span class="o">]</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
 <span class="nb">source</span> <span class="k">$(</span>brew --prefix<span class="k">)</span>/etc/bash_completion
<span class="k">fi</span>
</pre></div>


<p>There are many other useful Homebrew commands, all of which can be seen by running <code>man brew</code> in the&#xA0;terminal.</p>
<h2 id="just-the-basics">Just the&#xA0;basics</h2>
<p>These are obviously just the basics. If you have any interest in Python, have a look at my guide to setting up a <a href="http://hackercodex.com/guide/python-development-environment-on-mac-osx/">Python Development Environment on Mac <span class="caps">OS</span> X</a>.</p>
