I had art class at school. I had science class at school. Sometimes I did watercolors on the weekend. Sometimes I taught myself programming on the weekend.</p><figure name="32f0" id="32f0" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*R2ri9uyq4SFYZWn4nau3MQ.png"></div></figure><p name="09b5" id="09b5" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">And when it came time to decide what to study and what to do with my life, I felt forced to choose between the two. When I was looking into applying to art schools, the art schools I was interested in had no math classes higher than college algebra. Meanwhile, I was set on learning both life drawing and multivariable calculus.</p><figure name="5c38" id="5c38" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0oCBXtKSgMEbBlDbvwqC6w.png"></div></figure><p name="c31d" id="c31d" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">I ended up going to engineering school at MIT. I continued to draw in my notebooks while listening to lectures, at night, on the weekends. We live in a culture that values specialization, that values honing in on one thing particularly, and I always felt weird about not spending my weekends on programming side projects, like many of my classmates. I felt weird about liking two very different things equally.</p><p name="126c" id="126c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">It also made me feel sad to imagine a life with a job where I only used one of the two things that was so important to me.</p><figure name="d6bd" id="d6bd" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*M30pEBoAc8oTCBkPm8tkNQ.png"></div></figure><p name="e4f2" id="e4f2" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">As I was trying to piece together all the parts of who I was, a close friend of mine said, “I think that the unifying thing about all of your interests is that you really like creating and making things, whether that’s a painting or a program.” It was at that moment that I stopped feeling weird about loving both engineering and art, &amp; embraced it, and explored how art and technology were connected. And that’s what I’d like to talk about in this post.</p><figure name="8c6a" id="8c6a" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*2SOCvTVaczYe2mfIwQZHmQ.png"></div></figure><p name="5ae7" id="5ae7" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Design makes technology usable.</p><figure name="9a15" id="9a15" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*3_EZUIlE_Xz5dPxN-tsOkg.png"></div></figure><p name="5c8e" id="5c8e" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">If a website or app is poorly designed, it will be hard for people to use, and it won’t matter so much how amazing the underlying technology is.</p><figure name="bce9" id="bce9" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*Xt0RYLouXuByc2DZ0H9uxQ.png"></div></figure><p name="8113" id="8113" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">If technology aims to improve the lives of people, the usability of its design is just as important as the technology itself.</p><figure name="9e3d" id="9e3d" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*a8m7KKKta6HsBdIiriEUng.png"></div></figure><p name="0a58" id="0a58" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Using design and art to teach math and science is one of the topics closest to my heart.</p><figure name="6b37" id="6b37" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*tBmUAV0lTpTuyKwUjWANoQ.png"></div></figure><p name="fa58" id="fa58" class="graf--p graf-after--figure"><a href="http://twitter.com/lindaliukas" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Linda Liukas</a>, programmer and founder of Rails Girls, a weekend workshop for learning how to code, left her job to write a children’s book about programming, <a href="http://www.helloruby.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Hello Ruby</em></a>.</p><p name="3444" id="3444" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Her illustrations are colorful and disarming and convey the message that technology is fun and creative and whimsical.

Doraemon was always pulling fantastical gadgets out of his magic pocket. These were things like cameras that took 3D photos of objects and then 3D printed them.</p><p name="5d15" id="5d15" class="graf--p graf-after--p">These engineers had grown up with the life dream was to make all of the fantastical gadgets from their childhood come true.</p><figure name="5431" id="5431" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*AfuVNwsHe8_CBb7Dpl983g.png"></div></figure><p name="6b13" id="6b13" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">And when I worked in the humanoid robotics division of Honda Research, most of my coworkers told me that their inspiration for studying robotics was the Japanese cartoon <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Astroboy</em>, about a little robot boy who fights crime in future Tokyo.</p><figure name="5ce2" id="5ce2" class="graf--figure graf-after--p" score="-12.5"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" score="6.25"><img class="graf-image" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*F4v9Yyzyyq2rKSxYBMguYQ.png"></div></figure><p name="8082" id="8082" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Why is it significant that people in research labs are inspired to build technology from a fantasy/sci-fi/comic book lens?</p><p name="7ad6" id="7ad6" class="graf--p graf-after--p">When I ask high school students what they’d like to learn how to make if they knew how to hardware hack or code, they say things like, “Maybe a social app.” “Maybe some kind of a website.” But you get very different answers if you ask them, “What household objects would you enchant if you were in a Hogwart’s charm class?”</p><p name="2930" id="2930" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Why?
