	<p>The benefits of UI design systems are now well known. They lead to more cohesive, consistent user experiences. They speed up your team&#x2019;s workflow, allowing you to launch more stuff while <strong>saving huge amounts of time and money in the process</strong>. They establish a common vocabulary between disciplines, resulting in a more collaborative and constructive workflow. They make browser, device, performance, and accessibility testing easier. And they serve as a solid foundation to build upon over time, helping your organization to more easily adapt to the ever-shifting web landscape.</p>
<p>In order to create these systems, we have to establish more pattern-driven design and development workflows. We need to break our interfaces down into smaller parts, but we simultaneously need to ensure those parts come together to form a beautiful and functional whole. &#x201C;<a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2">Atomic design</a><sup class="po" id="note-1"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#1">1</a></sup>&#x201D; is a helpful mental model that helps us do just that, and Pattern Lab is a suite of tools that helps bring these atomic design systems to life.</p>
<p>After over two years of hard work, we&#x2019;re happy to announce <a href="http://patternlab.io/">Pattern Lab 2</a><sup class="po" id="note-2"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#2">2</a></sup>! Totally reimagined, Pattern Lab 2 is an open-source suite of tools to help you and your team <strong>create and maintain thoughtful UI design systems</strong>. At its core, it&#x2019;s a static site generator that stitches together patterns and allows you to design with dynamic data.</p>
<p>A few highlights of the new version include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A totally restructured core that supports more languages, templating engines, and data formats</li>
<li>Supporting Markdown for pattern documentation</li>
<li>Adding YAML support as well as JSON for managing dynamic data</li>
<li>Plugins to extend and enhance Pattern Lab&#x2019;s functionality</li>
<li>A themable, extendable, redesigned frontend UI</li>
</ul>
<p>But more than anything, Pattern Lab 2 has been designed and built so your team can effectively use it during every phase of your design system process, from the very beginning all the way through to its long-term maintenance.</p>

<p>Your team has been tasked with making a new application and underlying design system. Once upon a time, your teams&#x2019; UX designers might have holed up in a room to define the product by way of monolithic, heavily-annotated wireframes. Once approved, they&#x2019;d get passed off to visual designers who would then apply color, typography, and texture to bring the wireframes to life. After <code>homepage_v9_final_forReview_jimEdits_05-12__FINAL.psd</code> finally gets approved, the designs are sent off to the frontend developers, who quickly burst into tears since the designs contain a slew of unrealistic layouts, improbable user content (every username is only 4 characters&#x2014;how convenient!), and a potpourri of font faces and incongruent design patterns.</p>
<p>The throw-over-the-wall design process is dead and gone. Collaboration, iteration, and quick development are essential for tackling this ever-shifting, diverse web landscape. We need to get into the browser as soon as possible and test designs under real-world variables like responsiveness, performance, ergonomics, and motion. That&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s critical to treat <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/#development-is-design">front-end development as a core part of the design process</a><sup class="po" id="note-4"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#4">4</a></sup>, and why it&#x2019;s so crucial to get designers and frontend developers working closely together. At the end of the day, we&#x2019;re all working on the same UI. </p>
<p>Setting up an instance of Pattern Lab on Day 1 of your project can create a shared workshop &#x2014; or laboratory, if you will &#x2014; equipped with design and development tools, a watercooler, a whiteboard, and a microscope. It provides a place for each discipline to contribute their perspective to the living, breathing design system. In a real sense, Pattern Lab can serve as the hub of your design system project, minimizing the need to create overly verbose wireframes, red-lined static comps, and other clunky static artifacts. </p>
<p>Sounds great, right? Let&#x2019;s walk through how you can spin up Pattern Lab on Day 1 of your project.</p>
<p>Pattern Lab 2 comes in both <a href="http://patternlab.io/download.html">PHP and Node flavors</a><sup class="po" id="note-5"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#5">5</a></sup>. <em>Teams, choose your adventure!</em> Some projects yield a clear tech-stack choice. Others come down to team skillset or environmental precedence. Whichever the platform, Pattern Lab 2 is poised to help you and your team collaborate on building your new application and design system. Whatever your platform choice, know that with either version Pattern Lab will produce nearly identical results &#x2014; much like cars of different makes and models all bring you to the same destination.</p>
<h4 id="installing-pattern-lab">Installing Pattern Lab <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#installing-pattern-lab" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Once the appropriate <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/requirements.html#node">prerequisites are installed</a><sup class="po" id="note-6"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#6">6</a></sup>, you&#x2019;ll be ready to install Pattern Lab. Let&#x2019;s take a look at how to install Pattern Lab Node, but keep in mind that <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/installation.html#php">PHP instructions are also available and are similar.</a><sup class="po" id="note-7"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#7">7</a></sup></p>
<p>From your terminal window, navigate to a directory you&#x2019;d like to install Pattern Lab into. Then type the following commands:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>git clone https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp.git</code></li>
<li><code>npm install</code></li>
<li>Once complete, <code>gulp patternlab:serve</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Running <code>npm install</code> will pull down the latest dependencies, and <code>gulp patternlab:serve</code> will generate and self-host Pattern Lab, opening the frontend in your default browser. And if you don&#x2019;t wish to clone the git repository directly, you could alternatively <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp/releases/latest">download the latest release</a><sup class="po" id="note-8"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#8">8</a></sup> and then perform steps 2 and 3. </p>
<p>With Pattern Lab up and running, your team now has a hub for which to design, develop, and review your soon-to-be-established design system. </p>
<h4 id="pattern-labs-filesystem">Pattern Lab&#x2019;s Filesystem <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#pattern-labs-filesystem" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Pattern Lab compiles everything found in your project&#x2019;s <code>/source</code> folder into static HTML files that live in the <code>/public</code> folder. This output can then be displayed or consumed individually or inside the style guide frontend. Let&#x2019;s take a look at Pattern Lab&#x2019;s filesystem and what lives inside of <code>source/</code>:</p>
<figure><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_1-opt.png" alt="Pattern Lab&#x2019;s filesystem"><br>

<ul>

<li><code>_meta/</code> &#x2013; where the <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-header-footer.html"><code>&lt;head&gt;</code> and foot</a><sup class="po" id="note-11"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#11">11</a></sup> (which bookend all of your patterns) information resides. </li>
<li><code>_patterns/</code> &#x2013; where your <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-organization.html">patterns</a><sup class="po" id="note-12"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#12">12</a></sup>, pattern documentation, and pattern-specific data reside. </li>

<li>images &#x2013; where your images can reside</li>
<li>js &#x2013; where your javascript can reside</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth stressing that Pattern Lab doesn&#x2019;t force any frontend conventions or production dependencies onto you. How you decide to structure your folders and which technologies you choose is totally up to you. If you want to call your folder <code>/stylesheets</code> instead of <code>/css</code> go for it! Want to use Sass? Nice! Love jQuery? Great! Hate it? That&#x2019;s fine too! Pattern Lab simply exists to stitch your patterns together and gets out of the way of any frontend decisions you make. You can even configure how your <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-managing-assets.html">assets are managed</a><sup class="po" id="note-13"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#13">13</a></sup> as they travel from from <code>source/</code> to <code>public/</code>. </p>

<p>Atomic design is a helpful mental model to think about constructing UI design systems, but it&#x2019;s certainly <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#whats-in-a-name">not rigid dogma</a><sup class="po" id="note-14"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#14">14</a></sup>. It&#x2019;s important to choose a nomenclature that helps your team speak the same language and do great work together.</p>
<p>Pattern Lab&#x2019;s naming conventions, like most aspects of the software, are entirely configurable. While Pattern Lab <code>patterns/</code> folder defaults to &#x201C;atoms&#x201D;,&#x201D;molecules&#x201D;, &#x201C;organisms&#x201D;, &#x201C;templates&#x201D;, and &#x201C;pages, you&#x2019;re free to modify, remove, or add to your heart&#x2019;s desire. For instance, if we were to recreate <a href="https://medium.com/ge-design/ges-predix-design-system-8236d47b0891#.f1gp6kch7">GE&#x2019;s Predix design system&#x2019;s taxonomy</a><sup class="po" id="note-15"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#15">15</a></sup> &#x2014; which consists of Principles, Basics, Components, Templates, Features, and Applications &#x2014; we would structure Pattern Lab&#x2019;s <code>/source/_patterns/</code> directory to be as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup"> /00-Principles/

 /01-Basics/

 /02-Components/

 /03-Templates/

 /04-Features/

 /05-Applications/
</code></pre>
<p>Pattern Lab is designed to conform to your workflow, not the other way around.</p>

<p>Even during the first days or hours of a project, everyone has something to contribute to your Pattern Lab. This is a time for exploring, figuring things out, and creating alignment. Each role conducts different activities, but their output and input is linked. Each is inflating a separate tire of the vehicle that will get you all to your destination. </p>
<h4 id="defining-lo-fidelity-ia-in-pattern-lab">Defining lo-fidelity IA in Pattern Lab <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#defining-lo-fidelity-ia-in-pattern-lab" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Early UX design work involves determining the application&#x2019;s information architecture. Rather than immediately reaching for high-fidelity wireframe tools that tend to prematurely define layouts and technical functionality, it&#x2019;s better to create lo-fi sketches that establish what goes on a particular screen and in what general order. This work can take the form of napkin sketches, bulleted lists, or spreadsheets. Since Pattern Lab supports basic markup, it&#x2019;s possible to quickly translate these <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/02/create-content-wireframes-for-responsive-design/">content reference diagrams</a><sup class="po" id="note-16"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#16">16</a></sup> into the browser right away. For the Pittsburgh Food Bank <a href="http://foodbank.bradfrostweb.com/timeline/">redesign</a><sup class="po" id="note-17"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#17">17</a></sup>, we stubbed out the each template using this approach.</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_2-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_2-opt.png" alt="For the redesign of the Pittsburgh Food Bank website, wireframes were quickly translated from paper sketches into Pattern Lab using some dirt-simple markup and placeholder divs."></a><sup class="po" id="note-18"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#18">18</a></sup><br>

</figure>
<p>So the homepage template code, found in <code>/source/_patterns/templates/homepage.mustache</code> looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">{{&gt; organisms-header }}

&lt;div class="fpo"&gt;Mission Statement&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="fpo"&gt;Campaign&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="fpo"&gt;Get Help&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="fpo"&gt;Give Help&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="fpo"&gt;Learn&lt;/div&gt;

{{&gt; organisms-footer }}
</code></pre>
<p>We&#x2019;re including a header and footer pattern, and then simply stubbing out the content we&#x2019;re anticipating to include on this page. </p>

<p>Early visual design work involves exploring typography, color palettes, and other aspects of the visual brand. Historically, designers might leap into creating high-fidelity, desktop-centric Photoshop mockups, designers now have helpful tools like <a href="http://styletil.es/">style tiles</a><sup class="po" id="note-20"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#20">20</a></sup>, <a href="https://typecast.com/">Typecast</a><sup class="po" id="note-21"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#21">21</a></sup> and <a href="http://danielmall.com/articles/rif-element-collages/">element collages</a><sup class="po" id="note-22"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#22">22</a></sup> to establish visual design direction without resorting to premature, high-fidelity comps. </p>
<p>As decisions get made around color palettes and font pairings, Pattern Lab can capture the results of those design decisions, ensuring the design and development team aren&#x2019;t unintentionally generating 50 shades of gray.</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_3-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_3-opt.png" alt="Pattern Lab documents color palettes and font families, and other visual design elements.

<p>And then there&#x2019;s frontend code. In these early stages of a project, frontend developers may be tempted to sit tight and wait for designers to come up with a direction before diving into code. But this type of thinking keeps designers and developers out of sync with each other and prevents true collaboration from happening. </p>
<p>Like prep chefs at a restaurant, developers have a huge opportunity to get to work <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/#frontend-prep-chef">prepping</a><sup class="po" id="note-25"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#25">25</a></sup> the patterns and code that will ultimately become the final design system. In the early days of the project, developers can begin stubbing out patterns and and <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-header-footer.html">importing</a><sup class="po" id="note-26"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#26">26</a></sup> <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/editing-source-files.html">assets</a><sup class="po" id="note-27"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#27">27</a></sup> into Pattern Lab, getting things set up early so designers and developers can spend more time actually working together to design and build the UI. </p>
<p>Color palettes, real copy, and layout have yet to be established, but that shouldn&#x2019;t stop developers from scaffolding the structures that support the content wireframes. Take a hero <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-organization.html">pattern</a><sup class="po" id="note-28"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#28">28</a></sup>, for example:</p>

Here&#x2019;s the markup for <code>block-hero.mustache</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;a href="{{ url }}" class="c-block-hero"&gt;
 {{&gt; atoms-hero-img }}

 &lt;h2 class="c-block-hero__headline"&gt;{{ headline.medium }}&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- end c-block--hero--&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The double curly bracket code (<code>{{}}</code>) is <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a><sup class="po" id="note-71"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#71">71</a></sup><sup class="po" id="note-32"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#32">32</a></sup> templating code, which allows us to define dynamic content and include patterns inside one another. For example, the code <code>{{&gt; atoms-hero-img }}</code> tells Pattern Lab to look for an atom called &#x201C;hero-img&#x201D; and include it in the pattern. The hero unit itself can then be included in more complex patterns using the same include convention using the following: <code>{{&gt; molecules-hero }}</code>. </p>
<p>This Russian nesting doll approach to including patterns allows your codebase to stay nice and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a><sup class="po" id="note-33"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#33">33</a></sup>, meaning that if you make an edit to any particular pattern, anywhere that pattern is included will be updated automatically. This keep your designs and codebase in sync and consistent. And on top of all that, this continual build up of patterns can yield near-complete interfaces in short order!</p>

<p>The information architecture has started to take shape, the initial aesthetic direction has been established, and nascent patterns have been stubbed out in Pattern Lab. Now the team can now collectively dive into building out the interface design system in earnest. Let&#x2019;s discuss how to use Pattern Lab to turn a vague sense of direction into a beautiful, functional, thoughtful, and complete design system.</p>

<p>One important concept of atomic design is the differences between <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#templates">templates</a><sup class="po" id="note-34"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#34">34</a></sup> and <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#pages">pages</a><sup class="po" id="note-35"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#35">35</a></sup>. Templates define the underlying content structure of a UI, while pages are specific instances of those templates that replace that content structure with real representative content. Both are necessary to document content parameters while also showing the design patterns in action and populated with real content.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful Pattern Lab features is the ability to swap in different representative content into your UI patterns to ensure they can handle the dynamic nature of your content. What if your user doesn&#x2019;t upload a profile picture? What if the user has 13 items in their shopping cart versus 2 items? What if one of those products has 14 potential variations? What if the blog post title contains 400 characters? Return user? First-time user? What if the article has no comments? Or what about when it has seven layers of nested comments? What if we need to display an urgent message on the dashboard when their account is hacked? Pattern Lab allows you to manipulate data to express any number of various UI states and variants of any template.</p>
<h4 id="page-specific-data">Page-Specific Data <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#page-specific-data" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Initial data in Pattern Lab is stored in a file called <code>/source/_data/data.json</code>, which contains the data that patterns will initially consume to be displayed in the style guide and template views. Your default <code>data.json</code> may look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
 "headline" : {
 "short" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit (37 characters)",
 "medium" : "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit iopa. (76 characters)"
 },
 "url": "#",
 "imgHero" : {
 "src": "../../images/fpo_hero-opt.png",
 "alt": "Hero Image"
 },
 "imgLandscape" : {
 "src": "../../images/fpo_16x9-opt.png",
 "alt": "Landscape Image"
 },
 "mediaList": []
}
</code></pre>
<p>You can reference these pieces of data in your patterns (i.e. including <code>{{ headline.short }}</code> in a pattern) to achieve results like this: </p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_6-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_6-opt.png" alt="A homepage template rendered in Pattern Lab and stubbed out with default data defined in data.json."></a><sup class="po" id="note-38"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#38">38</a></sup><br>

</figure>
<p>At the page level, we want to replace those grayscale images and lorem ipsum placeholder text with real content. To accomplish this, we&#x2019;ll make a new file right next to <code>/source/_patterns/pages/homepage.mustache</code> called <code>homepage.json</code>, where we can override the initial data defined in `data.json. That might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">"imgHero" : {
 "src": "../../images/sample/hero-forest.jpg",
 "alt": "Forest"
 },
 "headline" : {
 "medium" : "Track your hikes. Challenge your friends. Get out there and start exploring."
 },
 "toutList" : [
 {
 "url": "link.pages-blog-detail",
 "headline": {
 "short" : "Best winter hikes around the world"
 },
 "imgLandscape" : {
 "src": "../../images/sample/tout-winter-hiker.jpg",
 "alt": "Hiker with back pack walking in snow"
 }
 },
 {
 "url": "link.pages-login",
 "headline": {
 "short" : "Sign in to view your dashboard"
 },
 "imgLandscape" : {
 "src": "../../images/sample/tout-leaves.jpg",
 "alt": "Green Leaves"
 }
 },
 {
 "url" : "link.pages-about",
 "headline": {
 "short" : "Learn about our mission"
 },
 "imgLandscape" : {
 "src": "../../images/sample/tout-mountains.jpg",
 "alt": "Mountain"
 }
 }
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>This results in a UI that looks like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_7-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_7-opt.png" alt="Pattern Lab takes the data defined in &lt;code&gt;homepage.json&lt;/code&gt; and overrides the default data defined in data.json to render a UI that would be similar to what users would interact with.

<p>Our design systems need to be flexible and adapt to the reality of the content that lives in our applications. We need to concurrently account for the best-case situations, the worst, and everything in between. </p>
<p>Expressing these UI variations in static design tools is an exercise in tediousness and redundancy, which may explain why they&#x2019;re rarely designed. But Pattern Lab&#x2019;s pseudo-pattern feature allows us to articulate (sometimes wildly) different scenarios with just a few changes to our data.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say we&#x2019;re making a hike-tracking app whose dashboard displays a list of hiking statistics: elevation climbed, number of trails hiked, steps taken, and so on. For an active user who has been consistently inputting content into the app, the UI might look something like this:</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_8-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_8-opt.png" alt="Here&#x2019;s a hypothetical dashboard for a fictitious hike-tracking app. Pattern Lab replaces default data with page-specific data to showcase what a user might see after logging in."></a><sup class="po" id="note-42"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#42">42</a></sup><br>
<figcaption>Here&#x2019;s a hypothetical dashboard for a fictitious hike-tracking app. Pattern Lab replaces default data with page-specific data to showcase what a user might see after logging in.

</figure>
<p>In <code>/source/_patterns/pages/dashboard.json</code>, our data would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{ 
 "blockFeature":{ 
 "number":"4,500",
 "headline":{ 
 "short":"Feet of Elevation Gain"
 },
 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"100",
 "label":"Progress: 100%"
 }
 },
 "tileList":[ 
 { 
 "number":"16",
 "headline":{ 
 "short":"National Parks"
 },
 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"20",
 "label":"Progress: 20%"
 }
 },
 { 
 "number":"500",
 "headline":{ 
 "short":"Hikes"
 },
 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"40",
 "label":"Progress: 40%"
 }
 },
 { 
 "number":"62,500",
 "headline":{ 
 "short":"Calories Burned"
 },
 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"60",
 "label":"Progress: 60%"
 }
 },
 { 
 "number":"94,300,843",
 "headline":{ 
 "short":"Steps"
 },
 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"80",
 "label":"Progress: 80%"
 }
 }
 ],
 ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>With this data, Pattern Lab is able to populate the UI with this user&#x2019;s wealth of generated content. </p>
<p>However, this scenario may not be all that common. For every ambitious user who takes the time to populate every field and connect every available application, there are likely to be dozens of casual users who don&#x2019;t fill in every blank and take advantage of all the app&#x2019;s features. For that matter, at one point in every user&#x2019;s journey, they are entirely new to the interface! Let&#x2019;s articulate these important variations using Pattern Lab&#x2019;s pseudo-pattern feature.</p>
<p>In our <code>/source/_patterns/pages/</code> directory, we can create a new pseudo-pattern called <code>dashboard~new-user.json</code>. This will create another instance of the page that inherits all the data from <code>dashboard.json</code>, but also allows us to further modify or extend the data. In the case of <code>dashboard~new-user.json</code>, we can override bits of a data to demonstrate what a new user experience might look like: </p>

</figure>
<p>And here&#x2019;s the data we&#x2019;re adding to the file to accomplish this UI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{ 
 "blockFeature":{ 
 "styleModifier":"featured",

 "short":"Feet of Elevation Gain"

 "progress":{ 
 "max":"100",
 "progressValue":"0",
 "label":"Progress: 0%"

 }
 }
 ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>By overriding some of the values in <code>dashboard.json</code> we&#x2019;re able to modify the content and turn on/off particular patterns.</p>
<p>In another instance, we may need to demonstrate what the UI looks like when there&#x2019;s a security issue or some other problem with the user&#x2019;s account. We can create the <code>dashboard~hacked.json</code> pseudo-pattern to create the following UI:</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_10-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_10-opt.png" alt=""></a><sup class="po" id="note-46"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#46">46</a></sup><br>

</figure>
<p>Most of the data from <code>dashboard.json</code> will stay the same, but we&#x2019;ll add the following to create the error message:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
 "alert" : {
 "alertClass" : "error",
 "alertText" : "On May 22nd, hackers from a hidden underground tunnel somewhere in Siberia hacked our servers and compromised all of our sensitive data. &lt;a href='#'&gt; Please reset your password immediately!&lt;/a&gt;"
 }
}

<h4 id="pattern-parameters">Pattern Parameters <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#pattern-parameters" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>There are times when using Pattern Lab that warrant full pseudo-patterns, as illustrated above. But sometimes you may need to tweak or override only a single data value within a pattern, leaving the rest to be handled by the other dynamic display patterns. For these instances, pattern parameters are your tool of choice. Pattern parameters are a simple mechanism for replacing variables in an included pattern. They are limited to replacing variables in the included pattern and <strong>only </strong>the included pattern. Consider this excerpt of the detail template:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">...
&lt;div class="l-sidebar"&gt;

 {{# latestPosts }}

 {{&gt; organisms-section-media-list }}

 {{/ latestPosts}}

 {{# featuredPeople }}

 {{&gt; organisms-section-media-list }}

 {{/ featuredPeople}}

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--end .l-sidebar--&gt;

...
</code></pre>
<p>which is includes the section media list pattern.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;section class="c-section"&gt;
 {{# sectionTitle}}
 &lt;h2 class="c-section__title"&gt;{{ sectionTitle }}&lt;/h2&gt;
 {{/ sectionTitle }}

 {{&gt; organisms-media-list }}
 

{{# textButton }}
 {{&gt; atoms-text-button }}
 {{/ textButton }}
 

{{# overlay }}
 {{&gt; molecules-overlay }}
 {{/ overlay}}
&lt;/section&gt;&lt;!--end section--&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As we&#x2019;ve learned, <code>{{sectionTitle}}</code> for both the latestPosts and featuredPeople data blocks will populate from any companion .json present, with <code>/source/_data/data.json</code> as the global fallback. We are including a single pattern multiple times, however, and may want to quickly supply unique data to each pattern without having to create these keys in our .json. We can change the included section media lists to the following: </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">...

&lt;div class="l-sidebar"&gt;

 {{# latestPosts }}

 {{&gt; organisms-section-media-list(sectionTitle: "The latest from the moleskine") }}

 {{/ latestPosts}}

 {{# featuredPeople }}

 {{&gt; organisms-section-media-list(sectionTitle: "Staff Hikers") }}

 {{/ featuredPeople}}

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!--end .l-sidebar--&gt;

...
</code></pre>
<p>These two organisms will now use the <code>sectionTitle</code> variable defined here when rendering. Pattern parameters are powerful, but are only supported by the PHP and Node Mustache PatternEngines. Other template languages provide better solutions to this problem. <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-parameters.html">Check out the docs</a><sup class="po" id="note-48"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#48">48</a></sup> to read the full skinny on parameters parameters.</p>
<h4 id="stylemodifiers">styleModifiers <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#stylemodifiers" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Often you&#x2019;ll find yourself wishing to display stylistic variants of the same pattern, such as colored social media buttons or component states. An extension to the shorthand include syntax, <code>styleModifiers</code> supply additional classes to a pattern. Provided you construct a pattern <code>block-media</code> with <code>{{ styleModifier}}</code> within the class attribute: </p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;a href="{{ url }}" class="c-block-media c-block-media--{{ styleModifier }}"&gt;

 &lt;div class="c-block-media__media"&gt;

 {{&gt; atoms-square:c-block-media__img }}

 &lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;div class="c-block-media__body"&gt;

 &lt;h2 class="c-block-media__headline"&gt;{{ headline.short }}&lt;/h2&gt;

 &lt;p class="c-block-media__excerpt"&gt;{{ excerpt.medium }}&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- end c-block-media__body --&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- end c-block-media --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Including this pattern with a colon after the name sets the styleModifier:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">{{&gt; molecules-block-media:fullBleed }}
</code></pre>
<p>would yield an anchor tag like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;a href="path/to/url" class="c-block-media c-block-media--fullBleed"&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>styleModifiers</code> can be combined to supply multiple classes, using pipe (|) as a delimiter.</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">{{&gt; molecules-block-media:fullBleed|is-lazyLoaded }}
</code></pre>
<p>Between pseudo-patterns, pattern parameters, and <code>styleModifiers</code>, Pattern Lab makes it easier to demonstrate sometimes wildly different UI variations while keeping the underlying codebase DRY in the process.</p>

<p>A key element of a pattern-based workflow is embracing iteration and recognizing that patterns and the design will continue to evolve. <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/#the-part-and-the-whole">The parts will shape the whole, the whole will shape the parts</a><sup class="po" id="note-49"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#49">49</a></sup>, and the interconnected system of components will emerge as a result of this process.</p>
<p>Another natural consequence of this process is that the point of production shifts from the hands of UX and visual designers into the hands of frontend developers much earlier. Rather than burning a lot of precious time creating a slew of high-fidelity comps and detailed wireframes, design work can move from static documents into browser where your team can sooner address the realities of the web. </p>
<p>With Pattern Lab as the watering hole for the whole team, designers can better understand how decisions made in one area affect other areas. </p>

<p>It&#x2019;s important for our components, as well as our pages, to be flexible across the entire resolution spectrum.

<p>By having these viewport tools baked right into the frontend environment, designers and developers can huddle around Pattern Lab to determine where to insert breakpoints into the design.

<p>Some patterns may present themselves as self-documenting, but a pattern often requires some context or additional information to make things crystal clear. Things like definitions. usage guidelines, considerations, resources, and example images can and should find their way into pattern documentation. Pattern Lab 2&#x2019;s documentation uses Markdown with YAML front matter to create this documentation. The markdown file accompanies the pattern (for example, <code>media-object.md</code> must sit right beside <code>media-object.mustache</code>), and can be formatted like this: </p>
<pre><code>---
title: Utility Colors
---

The utility color palette defines colors that are used to convey meaning such as success, error, warning, and information to the user. These colors should be used for things like alert messages, form validation, tooltips, and other kinds of messaging.</code></pre>

<p>Markdown documentation means that IAs, visual designers, content strategists, business folks, etc can more easily contribute to living documentation. Product owners could even stub in functionality notes for new patterns before the pattern is even created. <a href="http://patternlab.io/docs/pattern-documenting.html">Improvements are planned</a><sup class="po" id="note-57"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#57">57</a></sup> to make pattern documentation more powerful, further making Pattern Lab an evergreen space for your team.</p>

<p>When looking at various patterns in a library, the lack of context can make it difficult to discern where they actually get used. Defining and describing pattern characteristics is one thing, but there&#x2019;s an opportunity to provide additional contextual information about your UI patterns.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Russian nesting doll nature of Pattern Lab, it can display what patterns make up any given component, and also show where that pattern is consumed in the design system.</p>

<p>Thanks to this feature, designers and developers have contextual information that comes in handy when QAing and/or making changes to the design system. If we wanted to make changes to a particular pattern, like doubling the size of the image or adding an additional text element, we&#x2019;d immediately know which patterns and templates would need re-tested and QA&#x2019;d to ensure nothing breaks with the changes. The lineage feature also helps point out unused or underutilized patterns so that teams can weed them out of the pattern library.</p>
<h4 id="showing-progress-with-pattern-states">Showing Progress with Pattern States <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#showing-progress-with-pattern-states" class="sr hsl">Link</a></h4>
<p>Taking the concept of pattern lineage a step further, you and your team can keep track of each pattern&#x2019;s progress and how it affects the whole system. Pattern Lab&#x2019;s pattern state feature can track progress of a pattern from development, through review, to completion. With pattern states, you&#x2019;ll always be able to answer &#x201C;Are all the patterns that comprise this template complete?&#x201D; </p>
<p>To give your pattern a state, you add a <code>state</code> to the frontmatter in that pattern&#x2019;s documentation file. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-markup">---
title: Block Media
state: inreview
---
The media block consists of...</code></pre>
<p>Applying this status will present the pattern state in a couple places across Pattern Lab.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s important to note that the state of a pattern can be influenced by the patterns it contains. Flagging a pattern like <code>{{&gt; molecule-media-block }}</code> as <code>inreview</code> will cause a ripple effect anywhere that pattern is included. This helps identify bottlenecks that need addressed in order to bring your design system home. </p>

<blockquote><p>&#x201C;The biggest existential threat to any system is neglect.&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2013; Alex Schleifer, Airbnb</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a very real risk that despite your team&#x2019;s best intentions, your carefully-crafted design system and pattern library will slip into oblivion. &#x201C;Never!&#x201D; you exclaim, but unfortunately design system efforts fall into a state of disrepair for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The level of effort required to keep pattern code up to speed with applications&#x2019; code bases is too high</li>
<li>The pattern library is thought of as mere documentation rather than as housing a living, breathing system.</li>
<li>The team fails to make the design system a key part of their workflow, and instead lets their process devolve into a series of hotfixes and ad hoc changes.</li>
<li>One discipline serves as gatekeepers to the pattern library, preventing it from becoming a helpful resource for every discipline</li>
<li>The pattern library isn&#x2019;t visible or attractive</li>
<li>Many other factors (lack of funding, technology mismatches, lack of governance model, and more)</li>
</ul>
<p>As Nathan Curtis <a href="https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/a-design-system-isn-t-a-project-it-s-a-product-serving-products-74dcfffef935">rightly says</a><sup class="po" id="note-65"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#65">65</a></sup>, making a design system isn&#x2019;t just another project, but rather a product meant to serve your organization&#x2019;s sites and apps. To create a system that serves your organization for years to come, your UI design system needs to be properly <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/">maintained</a><sup class="po" id="note-66"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#66">66</a></sup>, serve as an essential resource for the organization to keep coming back to, and continue to be a core part of your team&#x2019;s design and development workflow.</p>
<p>Pattern Lab has always been an effective tool for <em>creating</em> UI design systems, but has historically lacked in the <em>maintenance</em> department. Thankfully, that&#x2019;s all changed with Pattern Lab 2. The new version has many features that helps you successfully document and maintain your pattern libraries while continuing to serve as a key tool in your pattern-driven design and development process.</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s critical to reduce the amount of effort and friction required to keep both your pattern library and production environments up to date. The <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-5/#in-search-of-the-holy-grail">Holy Grail of design systems</a><sup class="po" id="note-67"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#67">67</a></sup> is an environment where changes to patterns in a design system are automatically updated in both the pattern library and production environments.</p>
<figure><a href="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_16-large-opt.png"><img src="https://media-mediatemple.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pattern-lab-2-image_16-opt.png" alt="With a Holy Grail setup, changes to the design system are automatically updated in both production environments and the pattern library."></a><sup class="po" id="note-68"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#68">68</a></sup><br>

</figure>
<p>The Holy Grail is often accomplished by using a frontend templating language to serve as the bridge between your pattern library and production environments. Pattern Lab 2&#x2019;s architecture now makes it possible to choose the templating engine that&#x2019;s right for your particular environment. As a result, you&#x2019;re able to get closer to achieving the Holy Grail. For instance, the team at Phase2 Technology <a href="https://www.phase2technology.com/blog/introducing-pattern-lab-starter-8/">have successfully integrated Pattern Lab 2 into their Drupal builds</a><sup class="po" id="note-70"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#70">70</a></sup> so that their clients&#x2019; pattern libraries and production builds are always in step with one another.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#x201C;By using the same templating engine, along with the help of the Component Libraries Drupal Module, the tool gives Drupal the ability to directly include, extend, and embed the Twig templates that Pattern Lab uses for its components without any template duplication at all!&#x201D;</p>
<p>&#x2013; Evan Lovely, Phase2 Technology</p></blockquote>
<p>Currently Pattern Lab 2 supports the popular <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a><sup class="po" id="note-71"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#71">71</a></sup><sup class="po" id="note-32"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#32">32</a></sup> and <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a><sup class="po" id="note-72"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#72">72</a></sup> templating engines, but the decoupled nature of Pattern Lab 2&#x2019;s editions (more on these in a bit) means that you can power Pattern Lab using the templating engine of your choice.</p>

<p>Your pattern library and accompanying style guide should be something that your team comes back to reference again and again. While it may not make sense to immediately surface code snippets and pattern usage information during the initial design and development process, design system users will find themselves reaching for these things as they apply the design system to actual applications. Pattern Lab 2 now has more advanced config options that let you <a href="https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Configuration#defaultshowpatterninfo">switch on pattern info by default</a><sup class="po" id="note-73"><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/07/building-maintaining-atomic-design-systems-pattern-lab/#73">73</a></sup> to become a more helpful documentation and reference tool.</p>

<p>There are some teams that need only to set up and maintain a single design system, but many of us work on multiple projects for multiple clients. Wouldn&#x2019;t it be great to start new design system projects from a setup that&#x2019;s tuned to your workflow and tool choices?</p>
<p>Pattern Lab 2 has been re-architected to achieve just that. No longer is Pattern Lab a standalone tool, but rather it&#x2019;s an ecosystem built atop a core library. These changes will also make it easier for the Pattern Lab team to push out new features.</p>
