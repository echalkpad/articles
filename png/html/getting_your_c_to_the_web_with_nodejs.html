<p>So, you've got some old C or C++ code, playing an important role in your business - but you desperately want to get that functionality on the web - maybe just internally to streamline your workflow, or maybe publically in order to fulfill some other goal. The problem, of course, is that C++ isn't exactly easy to put onto the web - so what are your options?</p>
<p>This post is kicking off a series dedicated to showing you how to take your legacy (or new) C/C++ code to the web by integrating it with <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>. In a previous series I detailed one option - Node.js Addons - but in this series I'm covering a few more, along with giving you some guidance on which method might be best in your situation.</p>
<h2 id="toc_0">Can't I just write a C++ web site?</h2>
<p>Well... yes - you could! People have been writing parts of web applications in C++ for a very long time - using CGI. If you want to take a look, check out the notes at the end of the post for some starting points. CGI isn't the most popular thing on the web these days though, it lacks a lot of productivity enhancements that makes web development so great today. More importantly, it introduces some significant performance and scalability issues. On the other hand, C++ has come a long way over the past few years in terms of expressiveness, and the C++14 standard has enabled a some really cool projects focused on writing modern MVC-styled web apps in pure C++. If that's your thing, check out <a href="http://siliconframework.org/">Silicon</a>.</p>
<p>The majority of web developers aren't C++ programmers, and frankly, unless ultra high performance from your web tier is critical, you are probably better off using languages providing a higher level of abstraction. The common players on the web being Ruby, Go, Node.js, Python, PHP along with many more...</p>
<h2 id="toc_1">Why Node.js?</h2>
<p>The first answer is... I like it. Seriously though, Node.js has a number of advantages. For one, it <strong>integrates</strong> really nicely with C++ in several different ways - which this post will outline. In general, Node.js also has a lot of benefits that dovetail with why you'd be using C++ in the first place - it's highly portable, it promotes performance at scale, and has a thriving <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">ecosystem</a>. </p>
<h2 id="toc_2">Why not just rewrite the C++?</h2>
<p>Ah... every developer's first instinct - "Let's rewrite this old code written in language X because language Y is so much cooler | better | faster | easier!". First off - if you have some legacy C++ code that is simple, small, and doesn't really need to be high performance - this might very well be the best answer. However, if you are in that category, you probably aren't reading this - you're likely almost done rewriting your C++ code.</p>
<p>There are a few practical reasons not to rewrite code. <strong>First</strong>, you might not have the code! Believe it or not, if you are working for a company that uses legacy tools to support their business, source code for these tools are often lost to time (I've seen this a bunch of times when working with engineering firms). A derivative of this is when your legacy code uses third-parth dependencies, which cannot be rewritten or modified. </p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, C/C++ can be complex - and if it's old, it might be really hard to decipher. Are you a web developer that is also a C++ guru? Are you <em>positive</em> you can completely recreate the precise inputs/outputes of this program? If it's a critical line of business tool, you are putting a <strong>ton</strong> of risk on your plate.</p>
<p>The <strong>third reason</strong> not to rewrite your C++ is because it might really want to be in C++! While Node.js has decent performance, it's simply not C/C++. If your application has extreme performance criteria, you aren't going to beat C++.</p>
<h2 id="toc_3">C++ and Node.js - your options</h2>
<p>I've come up with three general ways of integrating C++ code with a Node.js application - although there are lots of variations within each category:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automation</strong> - call your C++ as a standalone app in a child process.</li>
<li><strong>Shared library</strong> - pack your C++ routines in a shared library (dll) and call those routines from Node.js directly.</li>
<li><strong>Node.js Addon</strong> - compile your C++ code as a native Node.js module/addon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these options have their advantages and disadvantages, they primarily differ in the degree in which you need to modify your C++, the performance hit you are willing to take when calling C++, and your familiarity / comfort in dealing with Node.js and the V8 API.</p>
<h3 id="toc_4">How to choose</h3>
<p>The most obvious question to ask first is <strong>do you have access to the C++ source</strong>, <em>or just the binary?</em> Without source code, you need to hope the C++ program is either a command line program or a dll/lib shared library. If you are looking at a program written with only a graphical user interface&#x2026; well then you are in a world of pain. It&#x2019;s likely you are going to need to rewrite your application in order to make it work on the web.</p>
<h3 id="toc_5">Option 1 - Automation</h3>
<p>If your C++ runs as a standalone from a command line, you don&#x2019;t need the source code to take advantage of Option 1 - the <strong>automation option</strong>. You can run your C++ program unaltered, using Node's <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html">child process</a> API. This option works for bringing just about anything to the web - it really doesn&#x2019;t make a difference what language your command line program is written in if you are simply running it. If you are reading this hoping to get C code, Fortran code, or some other language onto the web - then this option is worth reading. I'll discuss this in the next post.</p>
<p>The automation option is not only for those <em>without</em> the underlying C++ code. If you have C++ code that either is currently, or could easily be turned into, a command line program - then this option is reasonable if you can live with the performance, and you don&#x2019;t really want to get into the hassles of language integration.</p>
<h3 id="toc_6">Option 2 - Shared Library / DLL</h3>
<p>If you are dealing with a C++ dll/lib, or you have the C++ source code and can make modest modifications in order to create a shared library, then the <strong>shared library</strong> approach might work well for you. I'll detail how you can do this using the <a href="https://github.com/node-ffi/node-ffi">Foreign Function Interface</a> module in the third post of this series. This option gives you more fine-grain control of how you integrate C++ into Node, because calls to C++ routines can be interleaved with Node.js code itself. While this approach brings you closer to full integration, you still have to deal with type conversions and blocking when calling C++. It's a great option if you want better integration, without investing a lot of time dealing with V8.</p>
<h3 id="toc_7">Option 3 - Node.js Addon</h3>
<p>If you have the C++ source code, and you are willing to learn a bit about <strong>Node.js Addons</strong>, then a third option is creating a native Node.js module out of your C++. While this is the more challenging approach, you gain a ton of flexibility and performance. You also have the option to call your C++ asynchronously so you don't block your web application's event-loop while your C++ is crunching numbers. The fourth post in this series will cover this option using the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/nan">Nan library</a>. I've also written about addons in previous posts (see Notes below). While we're at it, I'm also working on a book that will cover this in much more detail - <a href="http://scottfrees.com/ebooks/nodecpp/">check it out</a>!</p>
<h2 id="toc_8">A running example - Prime Numbers</h2>
<p>Throughout the next three posts in this series I'll be showing you examples of how to implement each of the options above. I want to use the same basic example in each. Prime numbers are extremely important for lots of stuff (i.e. cryptography), and their generation tends to be really computationally expensive. A quick search online will direct you mostly towards C and C++ implementations - and the really efficient ones are <em>complicated</em>. Looking at their source, you'll instantly recognize that you probably don't' want to rewrite them - unless you are just looking for a challenge - which is fine:).</p>
<p>One of the more effective algorithms is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>. There is a really popular C++ suite, <a href="http://primesieve.org/">primseieve</a> - but it's pretty complicated to build. Instead, I found a simpler implementation that is more suitable for our purposes. You can find the source code for it <a href="http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/achim/prime_sieve.html">here</a>, but it's also in the <a href="https://github.com/freezer333/cppwebify-tutorial">git repository</a> for this blog series.</p>

<h2 id="toc_9">Getting Started - a simple Node.js Web app</h2>
<p>Throughout this series I'll use the <strong>exact</strong> same Node.js web application. It's pretty bare-bones, there is a single HTML page with some JavaScript (AngularJS) that asks the web server for prime numbers under a user specified value. The web server responds with a JSON object containing the primes - computed using one of the several techniques I'll implement. </p>
<p>I assume the reader has some basic understanding of a Node.js web app. I created the app with Express on the backend and AngularJS on the frontend, but I stayed away from any complexity and eye/candy as to not distract from the purpose of these tutorials. It's also a great setup for an API into your C++ code - just ditch the UI!</p>
<p>To get started - clone my github repository and check out tag "start".</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">clone</span> <span class="n">https</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="c1">//github.com/freezer333/cppwebify-tutorial.git</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">cd</span> <span class="n">cppwebify</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">tutorial</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">git</span> <span class="n">checkout</span> <span class="n">start</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You can poke around the web app yourself - but the relevant bits are the front end - found in /web/views and the backend, found in /index.js and /routes. </p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at /index.js. The first ten lines or so are just boilerplate express code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">express</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'express'</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">();</span>
<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">bodyParser</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body-parser'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="kr">static</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'public'</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'view engine'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">'jade'</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">bodyParser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">json</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">bodyParser</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">urlencoded</span><span class="p">({</span> <span class="nx">extended</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kc">true</span> <span class="p">}));</span>
</pre></div>
<p>The next line line is building an array of "types" - which will eventually hold entries for each example in the post series. For now, we only have one - a Node.js primesieve implementation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">types</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
 <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="nx">title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"pure_node"</span><span class="p">,</span>
 <span class="nx">description</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">"Execute a really primitive implementation of prime sieve in Node.js"</span>
 <span class="p">}];</span>
</pre></div>
<p>Each of the entries in types will correspond to a route, found in the /routes directory. These are loaded dynamically from index.js and the web server is started by the final hand full of lines.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">types</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">use</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/'</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">title</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'./routes/'</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">type</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">title</span><span class="p">));</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">render</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'index'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">routes</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">types</span><span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">server</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3000</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Web server listing at http://localhost:%s'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">server</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">address</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="nx">port</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</pre></div>
<p>To launch the web server, navigate to the <code>/web</code> directory in your terminal and type the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">npm</span> <span class="n">install</span>
<span class="p">...</span> <span class="n">dependencies</span> <span class="n">will</span> <span class="n">be</span> <span class="n">installed</span>
<span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">node</span> <span class="n">index</span>
</pre></div>
<p>You need Node 0.12 or greater to be installed).</p>
<p>Now point your browser to <code>http://localhost:3000</code>. You'll get the index page, which lists the implementation options. For now, you'll just have one option - "pure_node". Click on it, and you'll see a page with a single number box. Type <code>100</code> and submit - and the Node.js implementation of primesieve will run and return all prime numbers under 100.</p>
<p><img alt="Results for primes under 100" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freezer333/cppwebify/master/posts/img001.png"></p>
<p>The primesieve implementation in Node.js is found in <code>routes/pure_node.js</code>. By comparison to the C implementation we'll use throughout the remainder of this series, it's mind-numbingly simple - but it gets the job done! The code that handles the actual response is the router's post method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">router</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">post</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'/'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
 <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">under</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">parseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">body</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">under</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="c1">// from the user</span>

<h2 id="toc_10">Up next...</h2>
<p>This post is kicking off a series where we'll dive into all three options for integrating C++ into Node.js - (1) automation, (2) shared library, and (3) addons. I've outlined why you'd choose each one, and shown you the basic example I'll be extending throughout the series. In the next post, we'll take a closer look at automation option.</p>
