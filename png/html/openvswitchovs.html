<p>This document describes how to build Debian packages for Open vSwitch.
To install Open vSwitch on Debian without building Debian packages,
see <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/INSTALL.md">INSTALL.md</a> instead.</p>

<p>These instructions should also work on Ubuntu and other Debian
derivative distributions.</p>

<p>Before you begin, consider whether you really need to build packages
yourself. Debian "wheezy" and "sid", as well as recent versions of
Ubuntu, contain pre-built Debian packages for Open vSwitch. It is
easier to install these than to build your own. To use packages from
your distribution, skip ahead to "Installing .deb Packages", below.</p>

<p>You may build from an Open vSwitch distribution tarball or from an
Open vSwitch Git tree with these instructions.</p>

<p>You do not need to be the superuser to build the Debian packages.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Install the "build-essential" and "fakeroot" packages, e.g. with
<code>apt-get install build-essential fakeroot</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain and unpack an Open vSwitch source distribution and <code>cd</code> into
its top level directory.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the build dependencies listed under "Build-Depends:" near
the top of debian/control. You can install these any way you like,
e.g. with <code>apt-get install</code>.</p>

<p>Check your work by running <code>dpkg-checkbuilddeps</code> in the top level of
your ovs directory. If you've installed all the dependencies
properly, dpkg-checkbuilddeps will exit without printing anything.
If you forgot to install some dependencies, it will tell you which ones.</p></li>
<li><p>Run:</p>

<p><code>fakeroot debian/rules binary</code></p>

<p>This will do a serial build that runs the unit tests. This will take
approximately 8 to 10 minutes. If you prefer, you can run a faster
parallel build, e.g.:</p>

<p><code>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=8' fakeroot debian/rules binary</code></p>

<p>If you are in a big hurry, you can even skip the unit tests:</p>

<p><code>DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS='parallel=8 nocheck' fakeroot debian/rules binary</code></p>

<p>(There are a few pitfalls in the Debian packaging building system
so that, occasionally, you may find that in a tree that you have
using for a while, the build command above exits immediately
without actually building anything. To fix the problem, run</p>

<p><code>fakeroot debian/rules clean</code></p>

<p>or start over from a fresh copy of the source tree.)</p></li>
<li><p>The generated .deb files will be in the parent directory of the
Open vSwitch source distribution.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These instructions apply to installing from Debian packages that you
built yourself, as described in the previous section, or from packages
provided by Debian or a Debian derivative distribution such as Ubuntu.
In the former case, use a command such as <code>dpkg -i</code> to install the
.deb files that you build, and in the latter case use a program such
as <code>apt-get</code> or <code>aptitude</code> to download and install the provided
packages.</p>

<p>You must be superuser to install Debian packages.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start by installing an Open vSwitch kernel module. See
debian/openvswitch-switch.README.Debian for the available options.</p></li>
<li><p>Install the "openvswitch-switch" and "openvswitch-common" packages.
These packages include the core userspace components of the switch.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Open vSwitch .deb packages not mentioned above are rarely useful.
Please refer to their individual package descriptions to find out
whether any of them are useful to you.</p>
