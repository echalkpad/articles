<p class="first-text"><a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-future-of-architecture-is-already-happening-in-port-1750319689">Wood is the future</a>. That&#x2019;s the feeling you get after looking through the 2016 award winners named by <a href="http://www.woodworks.org/" target="_blank">WoodWorks</a>, the United States wood building council.</p>








<p>All of these structures are made from wood, but not the traditional two-by-fours you&#x2019;re thinking of. These buildings make use of <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-designers-of-the-worlds-tallest-buildings-aim-to-b-1403290786">innovative new materials</a> like glued-laminated timber (glulam) and cross-laminate timber (CLT), both of which are gaining in popularity. They&#x2019;re part of a family of materials named mass timber, where wood is cut, stacked, and glued to make a strong material even stronger. It&#x2019;s cheaper, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-ancient-material-thats-being-used-to-develop-earthq-1747556211">performs better in earthquakes</a>, and is far more sustainable than most building methods out there now. It&#x2019;s also <a href="http://gizmodo.com/why-the-white-house-will-spend-2-million-to-promote-wo-1548773623">made here in the US</a>&#x2014;most mass timber products come from Southern Oregon.</p>








<p>For a good example of how the new wood works, take the top photo here from a project named <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-future-of-architecture-is-already-happening-in-port-1750319689">Framework</a>, an office tower in Portland, Oregon. From the street you might not notice any difference between this building and its century-old neighbors. But instead of masonry walls, the building is almost entirely composed of Douglas fir glulam. And that wood is left exposed for a stunning effect. That&#x2019;s the real beauty of wood&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t need to be covered up.</p>









<p>WoodWorks picks the best buildings that are using wood in non-residential applications so you can see how architects employ these materials on a larger scale. The hope is that by showcasing wood in such versatile designs, wood will become the material of choice for more and more architects down the road.</p>

<p>If a firehouse uses wood, that should tell you something about the material&#x2019;s safety and resilience, right? In fact, <a href="http://gizmodo.com/the-designers-of-the-worlds-tallest-buildings-aim-to-b-1403290786">mass timber burns much slower</a> than many other building materials.</p>

<p>Wood is not allowed for many applications due to antiquated Seattle building code. But this project was able to get an exemption because of the proven fire-resistance of mass timber, paving the way for more projects.</p>
