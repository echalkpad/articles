<p>Implementing a debugging tool may seem like a monumental task.
<code>gdb</code>, one of the most popular debuggers, is over 500,000
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code">SLOC</a> (according to
<code>cloc</code>); it&#x2019;s not exactly easy to pick up and read through, and it has many
auxiliary features not fundamental to a debugger&#x2019;s purpose. Engineers
aren&#x2019;t required to understand a debugger&#x2019;s internals to use one, and rightfully
so &#x2013; if we had to fundamentally understand something in order to use it,
we&#x2019;d use precious few things. We&#x2019;re more familiar with a debugger&#x2019;s features:
print a backtrace, hex dump some memory, set some watchpoints, or write some
macros combining these simpler tasks.</p>

<h2>Magnets. How do they work?</h2>

<p>To really understand what&#x2019;s involved in creating a debugging tool for a
language like Go, we must first understand general debuggers.</p>

<p>What is a debugger?</p>

<p>It&#x2019;s a tool that indicates what a program is doing during execution (otherwise
known as introspection); some debuggers let you control the program&#x2019;s
execution without recompiling or restarting it (commonly deemed interaction).</p>

<p>From the introspective perspective, a debugger extracts the state of an
application &#x2013; which functions your threads are executing, or the values of
variables, or the data contained in arbitrary memory locations.</p>

<p>On the interactive front, one might use a debugger to set a breakpoint,
which stops execution of an application before it reaches a certain point.
<code>break a_crashing_function</code> tells the debugger that the program should execute
as normal until it&#x2019;s about to execute instructions from that function.
At that point, the debugger will stop execution and transfer control back to
the user, who can then inspect state using the aforementioned introspection
features.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ll explore the introspective aspect in this article, which covers much of
the architecture and interesting features of debuggers.</p>

<p><strong>For simplicity, we will focus on the flow of debugging a live process on an
x86_64 Linux operating system &#x2013; qualify everything below with &#x201C;for a live
process on Linux.&#x201D; Some differences arise in other environments, but many of the
techniques are similar. We will also ignore many edge cases.</strong></p>

<h3>The introspective guts</h3>

<p>You have a long-running process and want to see what it&#x2019;s currently doing. You
execute a debugging tool on it and receive output describing, among other
things, callstacks for every thread and local variable data for each function.</p>

<p>How do we, the debugger, extract this information?</p>

<h4>The sauces</h4>

<p>We use two major data sources: the <code>/proc</code> pseudo-filesystem and the
executable file of the process itself.</p>

<p>The <code>/proc</code> filesystem (hereafter <code>procfs</code>) contains, among other things,
a representation of processes currently running on the system. This
representation is comprised of pseudo-files organized into a
hierarchy providing access to each process' memory and its various attributes,
such as executable path, thread list, and resource utilization.</p>

<p>They&#x2019;re called pseudo-files because they aren&#x2019;t real files
stored on disk; they&#x2019;re just nice interfaces to kernel memory that allow for
normal filesystem calls such as <code>open</code> and <code>pread</code>. One such pseudo-file is
<code>/proc/[pid]/mem</code>. This is what provides direct access to the process' memory.</p>

<p>The alternative to <code>procfs</code> would be using heavier-weight
system calls such as <code>ptrace</code> &#x2013; which we still use for a small subset of
process state, as we&#x2019;ll see later.</p>

<p>Our second data source, the executable for a process, is also retrieved from
<code>procfs</code>. In the simple case, we can use the <code>/proc/[pid]/exe</code> file, which is
a symbolic link to the path of the executable. We call <code>open</code> on the executable
file itself and parse it to retrieve its debug information.</p>

<p>This changes slightly when a process is
linked to shared libraries; each shared object will also have its own debug
information. We use <code>/proc/[pid]/maps</code> in this case. It provides descriptions
for each region of memory mapped into the process, such as the address range,
permission bits (read-write-execute-shared) for that range, and, most
importantly for a debugger, the file backing the memory region. This file can be
the aforementioned executable file or a shared library object file. When we&#x2019;re
interested in a particular instruction address, we search for a range containing
it in <code>/proc/[pid]/maps</code> and parse the associated backing file, if any, for
debug information, as we did above with just the executable file. We&#x2019;ll assume
we&#x2019;re working with the executable file for the remainder of this article.</p>

<p>The debug information stored in the executable file tells us how to
translate raw memory locations into recognizable program objects such as
functions, variables, and types. This is what debuggers like <code>gdb</code> use. Debug
information includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The locations of the program&#x2019;s functions and global variables</li>
<li>The stack layout of each function, dependent on the current location of
execution within the function &#x2013; i.e., the instruction pointer

<ul>
<li>Expressions that evaluate to the locations of local variables and
parameters on each function&#x2019;s stack</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The types of the variables, which, combined with the above location
information, indicate the memory range to read for any particular variable</li>
</ul>


<p>We&#x2019;ll explore debug information in more detail later.</p>

<p>There are other sources of data we use to provide more complete snapshots
of a system, but the above two are the most relevant.</p>



<p>The data sources:</p>

<ul>
<li>The process' memory through <code>procfs</code></li>
<li>The debugging information contained in the process' executable file</li>
</ul>




<h4>Be like water</h4>

<p>Now that we&#x2019;ve identified our data sources, we can focus on the overall flow
of a debugger. We&#x2019;ll go from the initial step of attaching a debugger to a
process to the final stage of generating the debugger&#x2019;s output. Throughout
these steps, we&#x2019;ll always read from the two major data sources using some
mechanism.</p>

<p>First, we must identify the process to debug using this process' <code>pid</code>,
or process id, which is a system-wide unique integer identifier. This is
assigned to each process by the kernel and can be retrieved by running a
command on a running executable&#x2019;s name, such as <code>pgrep a_buggy_process</code>.</p>

<h5>Attach and stop</h5>

<p>Before we can extract any data from the process, we need to pause its
execution. Failing to do so would cause data and liveness races
throughout the debugging process &#x2013; for example, we could try to read data
from a thread as it&#x2019;s exiting and afterwards. There are strategies for
minimizing stop duration, but those will be the subject of a future post.</p>

<p>To stop a process, we use the monolithic <code>ptrace</code> syscall.</p>

<blockquote><p>The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process
(the &#x201C;tracer&#x201D;) may observe and control the execution of another process
(the &#x201C;tracee&#x201D;), and examine and change the tracee&#x2019;s memory and registers.
It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and system call
tracing.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#x2013; <code>ptrace</code> man page</p>

<p>Though <code>ptrace</code> provides means to affect many aspects of a process' execution,
memory, and register state, the only operations we&#x2019;ll need for now are
<code>PTRACE_ATTACH</code> and <code>PTRACE_DETACH</code>.</p>

<p><code>PTRACE_ATTACH</code> establishes the tracer(debugger)-tracee(target process)
relationship and does a few useful things for us, some being:</p>

<ul>
<li>Stops the target process. Note &#x2013; <code>ptrace(PTRACE_ATTACH, ...)</code> must be called
on all target threads; it stops only the single thread provided to the command.
The main process thread is stopped first.</li>
<li>Allows the debugger to read from process memory/registers.</li>
</ul>


<p><code>PTRACE_DETACH</code> simply reverses these effects and allows the target process
to continue executing. Debuggers call <code>ptrace(PTRACE_DETACH, ...)</code> after they
finish their operations.</p>

<h5>Extract the thread list</h5>

<p>We&#x2019;ve now attached to and stopped the target process. The next step is data
extraction.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s assume we want just the state of the application at the time of the
snapshot request. The minimum set of information required to be useful is the
stacktrace of each running thread &#x2013; the series of calls leading up to the
currently executing function of the thread, beginning with the thread&#x2019;s start
function.</p>

<p>To do this, we&#x2019;ll need the list of threads owned by the process and the current
execution contexts of these threads, which is represented by their register sets.
The most important registers in such a set are <code>rip</code>, or <code>instruction pointer</code>,
and <code>rsp</code>, or <code>stack pointer</code>. The former is the memory location of the
instruction about to be executed on the thread; the latter is the current memory
location of the top (bottom, really, since the stack typically grows downwards)
of the stack.</p>

<p>To get the thread list, debuggers commonly use a library called <code>libthread_db</code>,
which essentially traverses and extracts information from the in-memory
representations of the threads of a given process. This isn&#x2019;t always viable;
some applications don&#x2019;t use threading libraries which create the data structures
<code>libthread_db</code> expects. There are operating system-dependent alternatives in
such cases (like <code>procfs</code>), as we&#x2019;ll see later with Go. For now, assume
<code>libthread_db</code> has worked. This will read data directly from the target
process' memory &#x2013; think of it as using <code>procfs</code>.</p>

<h5>Copy the registers</h5>

<p>So we&#x2019;ve made a few calls to this thread debugging library and now have a list
of thread objects for the process we&#x2019;re debugging. We need their register sets
to begin determining what the threads are doing. For this, we&#x2019;ll again use the
<code>ptrace</code> syscall.</p>

<p><code>PTRACE_GETREGS</code> and <code>PTRACE_GETFPREGS</code> are the <code>ptrace</code> actions we&#x2019;re
interested in; they will retrieve copies of the specified thread&#x2019;s
general-purpose and floating-point registers, respectively. As mentioned
previously, with respect to debugging flow, we really just need the <code>rip</code>
and <code>rsp</code> registers from these sets.</p>

<h5>Unwind</h5>

<p>Now we have the current register sets for each thread. The <code>rip</code> specifically
indicates the currently executing function. Remember, we want the entire
callstack for each thread, not just the currently executing function. Raw
register values are also of little use to an end-user; people know their
functions' names, not their functions' locations in memory. We&#x2019;ll need to
translate these instruction addresses to their associated symbols.</p>

<p>This is where debugging information finally makes its entrance. It&#x2019;s used to
translate raw addresses and memory values to program elements familiar to the
programmer, such as function names.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s quickly go through generating the callstack for a specific thread. This
is generally referred to as unwinding (another topic for a future post).</p>

<p>To unwind a callstack, we want to know which function called the currently
executing function, and which function called the caller, and so on, up until
we hit the thread&#x2019;s starting function. We use the return address for this.
It&#x2019;ll be within the range of instruction addresses for the calling function
(we&#x2019;re ignoring edge cases &#x2013; like tail call optimization &#x2013; remember?).</p>

<p>When a function is called, the return address &#x2013; i.e., the address of the
instruction to execute after the called function completes &#x2013; is saved on the
stack before the callee executes anything. As this callee function executes,
it pushes and pops data onto and from the stack &#x2013; this data being the values
(like variables) the function uses to perform its work. Thus, depending on
where in a function execution is, the return address is stored at different
offsets relative to the current stack pointer.</p>

<p>The executable&#x2019;s debug information tells us what these offsets are at each
point the stack grows or shrinks. This is organized into a matrix of offsets
relative to a known register value, such as the current <code>rsp</code>, for a range of
addresses. We can find the matrix associated with a function by searching for
an entry &#x2013; called a Frame Description Entry, or <code>FDE</code> &#x2013; whose address range
contains the current <code>rip</code>.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the first few assembly instructions for a simple
<code>strtol</code> wrapper function:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>
<span class="line-number">3</span>
<span class="line-number">4</span>
<span class="line-number">5</span>
<span class="line-number">6</span>
<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">0000000000405450 &lt;strtol_wrapper&gt;:
</span><span class="line"> 405450: 41 55 push %r13
</span><span class="line"> 405452: 41 54 push %r12
</span><span class="line"> 405454: 49 89 f5 mov %rsi,%r13
</span><span class="line"> 405457: 55 push %rbp
</span><span class="line"> 405458: 53 push %rbx
</span><span class="line">...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>


<p>Assume the <code>rip</code> is <code>0x405458</code>. Searching the debug information for that (I
usually use <code>readelf --debug-dump=frames-interp &lt;executable_path&gt;</code> when
searching manually), we see this:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">7</span>
<span class="line-number">8</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line">000000f0 000000000000004c 000000c4 FDE cie=00000030 pc=0000000000405450..00000000004054ce
</span><span class="line"> LOC CFA rbx rbp r12 r13 ra
</span><span class="line">0000000000405450 rsp+8 u u u u c-8
</span><span class="line">0000000000405452 rsp+16 u u u c-16 c-8
</span><span class="line">0000000000405454 rsp+24 u u c-24 c-16 c-8
</span><span class="line">0000000000405458 rsp+32 u c-32 c-24 c-16 c-8
</span><span class="line">...</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>


<p>Each row in the debug output is the state of the stack before that particular
instruction executes (which is why there&#x2019;s no entry for <code>0x405457</code>). The values
we&#x2019;re interested in here are <code>CFA</code> and <code>ra</code>. The other register values are
useful for reasons we&#x2019;ll see soon, but they can be ignored for unwinding.</p>

<p><code>CFA</code> stands for Canonical Frame Address, which is the value of <code>rsp</code> when the
calling function called the current function. Put more simply, the <code>CFA</code> is
the <code>rsp</code> for the calling function, which we&#x2019;ll need when we continue
unwinding from that function.</p>

<p><code>ra</code> stands for Return Address. In the above case, it&#x2019;s been specified as an
offset relative to <code>c</code>, which is the current frame&#x2019;s <code>CFA</code> we&#x2019;ve just
extracted above. This is where the return address is stored, not the return
address itself, so we&#x2019;ll need to read this value from the process' memory
through <code>procfs</code>.</p>

<p>Match the instruction addresses from the assembly snippet to the ones in the
debug snippet, and you&#x2019;ll see the offsets change as expected. When we push
an 8-byte register, such as <code>%r12</code>, onto the stack, the offsets increase in
magnitude by 8 bytes. The starting offset from <code>rsp</code> to the <code>CFA</code> is <code>+8</code>
because the return address is stored in the first 8 bytes of the stack before
anything in the function executes and modifies the stack. Thus, the function&#x2019;s
starting rsp is already 8 bytes past its beginning. The offset of <code>ra</code> always
being <code>-8</code> (from the <code>CFA</code>) confirms this.</p>

<p>We now use the return address value and search this debug information again for
the frame description entry including that address. We use the <code>CFA</code> we&#x2019;ve
just derived as the new <code>rsp</code> and repeat the above process, stopping when
there&#x2019;s no return address (or we can&#x2019;t derive a valid one).</p>

<p>Unwinding is thus summarized as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use a thread&#x2019;s current instruction address to find the frame description in
the debug information.</li>
<li>Use that description to find the calling frame&#x2019;s next instruction address
and current stack pointer.</li>
<li>Use this caller&#x2019;s information to repeat this process until we reach a
stopping point.</li>
</ol>


<h5>Variables</h5>

<p>Now we have the instructions representing the callstacks for all threads.
Translated to their actual function names, these stacks are already useful
when debugging a program &#x2013; how often have you run a crashing application under
<code>gdb</code> and found the issue immediately after printing the backtrace with <code>bt</code>?</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ll often need more, however. A function could look fine even after reading
its code knowing there&#x2019;s a crash condition there. To go further, we&#x2019;ll need
variable data.</p>

<p>To get that, we again turn to the debugging information found in the executable
file. When evaluating the variables for each frame in a callstack, we use the
frame&#x2019;s <code>rip</code> and search for associated data, this time looking
for entries describing the function and its local variables (rather than the
frame&#x2019;s unwinding instructions). These entries indicate which local variables
the function creates; in which address ranges they are in scope; the types of
the variables, which specify their sizes in memory; the locations of the
variables, which can be expressions comprised of memory locations, registers,
and offsets; the names of everything as they appear in the source code; and so
on, giving us a complete picture of the state of a function. With this
information, a debugger can read what it needs to from specific regions of a
process' memory space and translate that into what is familiar to the
programmer.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ll see some examples of function and variable debug information below, but
knowing the specifics of this isn&#x2019;t important for understanding the overall
flow.</p>

<h4>And then&#x2026;</h4>

<p>That&#x2019;s it. We now have all callstacks for all threads with full
local variable information. There&#x2019;s much more a debugger can do to provide
further introspection, but these are the fundamentals.</p>



<p>The flow condensed:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <code>ptrace</code> to attach to and stop a process</li>
<li>Extract the thread list using <code>libthread_db</code> or <code>procfs</code></li>
<li>Use <code>ptrace</code> to extract the current register set of each thread</li>
<li>Use the debugging information in the executable file to unwind each thread&#x2019;s
callstack from the initial <code>rip</code> to the thread&#x2019;s starting function</li>
<li>Use the debugging information to retrieve variable state</li>
</ul>




<h4>And my axe</h4>

<p>Beyond the fundamentals, it&#x2019;s important to know the specifics of some
major components of debug information; without such knowledge, it&#x2019;s difficult
to understand what debuggers are capable of and how language internals affect
those capabilities. We&#x2019;ve already seen some of these components above, but
there are a few more to cover. First, however, some introductions are in order.</p>

<p>DWARF is the most widely used specification of debug information on Unix
systems.</p>

<p>Compilers and linkers emit DWARF debug information and store it in
specific sections in an executable, assuming it is compiled with debug
information enabled. If you&#x2019;re on a system using the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a> object
file format, these sections are typically prefixed with <code>.debug_</code>.</p>

<p>(Debug information may sometimes live elsewhere &#x2013; see
<a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Separate-Debug-Files.html">.gnu_debuglink</a>.)</p>

<p>There are several (mostly compatible)
<a href="http://dwarfstd.org/Download.php">standards</a> for DWARF. Some differences
between standards can result in some hairy bugs in debuggers themselves, as
we will see in a future post.</p>

<p>From the perspective of a programmer, the main structure in DWARF debug
information is the debugging information entry, or <code>DIE</code>. These represent
elements of the source program &#x2013; types, variables, functions, compilation
units, etc. Each DIE has an identifying tag, which defines the type of
the entry (e.g. variable vs. function), and an attribute set, which defines
the specific fields describing the entry (e.g. this particular variable entry
has an <code>external</code> attribute, which means variables described by this entry
are visible outside of their enclosing compilation units).</p>

<p>As an example, consider the following function:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line"> another_variable = a_variable + 2;
</span><span class="line"> if (a_parameter == true)
</span><span class="line"> return a_variable + another_variable;
</span><span class="line"> return a_variable - another_variable;
</span><span class="line">}</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Ignore most of the specific attributes; we are looking for a 1:1 mapping between
program elements and DIEs. The first DIE is the function, <code>simple_function</code>,
as we&#x2019;d expect &#x2013; this is the scope containing other program elements, like
local variables. This function DIE has several child DIEs, one for each
of its parameters and variables.</p>

<p>DIEs are organized into a graph. The portion of the graph representing ownership
(e.g. compilation units owning functions owning variables) is really represented
as a tree, with each compilation unit being a root node owning subprogram
(function) and global variable DIEs. Certain DIEs may reference others in a
non-ownership-related manner &#x2013; a variable DIE may reference a common type DIE
representing a <code>struct</code> used in multiple places.</p>

<p>We can see this graph in the <code>readelf</code> output above. Each DIE is prefixed by
its depth &#x2013; the <code>simple_function</code> DIE has a depth of 1, the <code>a_parameter</code>
parameter has a depth of 2, and so on. Each increase in depth indicates the
aforementioned parent-child ownership relationship. The <code>DW_AT_type</code> attribute
of the variable DIEs is an example non-ownership edge. Consider the
<code>a_variable</code> and <code>another_variable</code> DIEs. Their <code>DW_AT_type</code> attributes both
reference the location <code>0x57</code>, which is:</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>
<span class="line-number">2</span>

<span class="line-number">4</span>
</pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class=""><span class="line"> &lt;1&gt;&lt;57&gt;: Abbrev Number: 3 (DW_TAG_base_type)

</span><span class="line"> &lt;59&gt; DW_AT_encoding : 5 (signed)
</span><span class="line"> &lt;5a&gt; DW_AT_name : int</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>


<p>As both variables are <code>int</code> types in the source code, their types both
reference the common <code>int</code> type DIE.</p>

<p>To save space, DIEs are stored by writing just the values of their attributes;
the identifiers for each individual attribute are not written. Instead, the
entire DIE is preceded by an abbreviation code; these codes are defined as
attribute sets (with identifying information) stored in a separate debug section
of the executable file. Abbreviation codes are shared amongst DIEs. Any
identifying tag, like <code>DW_TAG_variable</code>, may have more than one abbreviation
code/attribute set &#x2013; for example, only some variables have an <code>external</code>
attribute, and so those variables would use a different attribute set while
still using <code>DW_TAG_variable</code>.</p>

<p>Though there are other structures in addition to DIEs, they aren&#x2019;t necessary
to understand to do significant work with debuggers.</p>

<h2>Fin</h2>

<p>With the information we&#x2019;ve discussed thus far, we now have a good framework
for understanding the introspective tasks debuggers do and how they do it.
In part two, we&#x2019;ll use this framework to investigate some of the specific work
involved in extending a debugger to support a
