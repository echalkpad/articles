 <p>Deis is an open source private Platform as a Service (PaaS) that simplifies deploying and managing your applications on your own servers. By leveraging technologies such as Docker and CoreOS, Deis provides a workflow and scaling features that are similar to that of Heroku, on the hosting provider of your choice. Deis supports applications that can run in a Docker container, and can run on any platform that supports CoreOS.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Have you ever wanted to experiment with a new project but were stymied by the "Getting Started" guide (with its tens or maybe even hundreds of manual steps)? Ever had a goal to spend part of your weekend crafting up a fantastic pull request for an open source project only to find that it took hours instead of minutes just to get to a productive development state? You're definitely not alone. I've found that most open source projects have a significant barrier to entry. That's not how it should be.</p>

<p>We at <a href="http://deis.io">Deis</a> realized we had a few rough spots that were plaguing potential users and preventing high-quality community contribution back into the project. So we've been working to alleviate some of the pains you might have experienced trying to stand up a Deis cluster for development and trial use cases.</p>

<p>In this guide, you'll get to experience a taste of the new and improved Deis provisioning process using the Deis project's new tool called <a href="https://github.com/deis/rigger">Rigger</a>.</p>

<h2>Preview</h2>

<p>If you don't have much time, this accelerated <a href="https://asciinema.org/">terminal recording</a> (only around a minute long!) shows what we'll be up to in the rest of this article:</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Rigger is designed to handle its own dependency management, but you will need to setup a few things before provisioning a Deis cluster with it. To follow along with this guide at home you'll need:</p>



<p>All the command in this tutorial can be run on a local Mac or Linux workstation (OS X &gt;= 10.10 and Debian/Ubuntu were tested). They can also be run on a Droplet, but that is not necessary.</p>

<p>The <code>zip</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>git</code> utilities need to be installed on whatever workstation you use to provision a Deis cluster with Rigger.</p>

<p>For example, if you are using an Ubuntu system, install them with the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zip make git
</code></pre></figure>
<p>The <code>git</code> utility is used through the article to download Rigger and an example application. The <code>zip</code> and <code>make</code> utilities are used by the Rigger provisioning script.</p>

<p>If you are running Mac OS X, you also need to agree to the Xcode license agreement to use git:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">sudo xcodebuild -license
</code></pre></figure>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> This article was written for Deis version 1.12.0. 
</p>

<h2>Step 1 &#x2014; Installing Rigger</h2>

<p>To install Rigger, first use <code>git</code> to download it:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">git clone https://github.com/deis/rigger.git
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Change to the directory created:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">cd rigger
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Then, execute the following command:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">./rigger
</code></pre></figure>
<p>When it first runs, you will see the following:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">Downloading rerun from GitHub...
</code></pre></figure>
<p>At the end of the output, you will see a list of available commands:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">Available commands in module, "rigger":
checkout: "checkout the Deis repo with version: $VERSION into directory: $DEIS_ROOT"
configure: "initialize a rigger varsfile to use with future commands"
 [ --advanced]: "configure all the nitty gritty details of the infrastructure and Deis deployment"
 [ --provider &lt;&gt;]: "which cloud provider to use to provision a Deis cluster"
 [ --version &lt;&gt;]: "choose what version of Deis to deploy"
create-registry: "Create a local dev registry"
deploy: "Install and Deploy Deis"
destroy: "destroy all infrastructure created by the provision step"
provision: "provision new infrastructure and deploy Deis to it"
 [ --cleanup]: "destroy cluster after action"
setup-clients: "download and stage deisctl and deis clients for your own use"
shellinit: "show the current sourceable environment variables (useful for eval-ing)"
 [ --file &lt;&gt;]: "use a specific file"
shell-reset: "an eval-able output that unsets variables that have been injected by rigger"
 [ --file &lt;&gt;]: "use a specific file"
test: "run a test suite on the provisioned Deis cluster"
 [ --type &lt;smoke&gt;]: "provide a type of test to run"
upgrade: "Tests upgrade path for Deis"
 [ --to &lt;master&gt;]: "Define version of Deis to upgrade to"
 [ --cleanup]: "destroy cluster after action"
 --upgrade-style &lt;graceful&gt;: "choose the style of upgrade you'd like to perform"
</code></pre></figure>
<h2>Step 2 &#x2014; Configuring the Deis Deployment</h2>

<p>To configure the Deis deployment to use DigitalOcean as the provider and a specific version of Deis, all we need to do is call:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">./rigger configure --provider "digitalocean" --version "1.12.0"
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Rigger will then ask you a few questions. It will all look like this:</p>

<pre>
-&gt; What DigitalOcean token should I use? DO_TOKEN (no default)
<strong>[enter or paste your DigitalOcean token here]</strong>
You chose: ******

-&gt; Which private SSH key should be used? SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_FILE [ /Users/sgoings/.ssh/id_dsa ]
1) /Users/sgoings/.ssh/id_dsa
2) ...
#? <strong>[enter a number]</strong>
You chose: 1) /Users/sgoings/.ssh/id_dsa

... output snipped ...

Enter passphrase for /Users/sgoings/.ssh/id_dsa: <strong>[enter your ssh passphrase]</strong>

Rigger has been configured on this system using ${HOME}/.rigger/<strong>&lt;id&gt;</strong>/vars
To use the configuration outside of rigger, you can run:

 source "${HOME}/.rigger/<strong>&lt;id&gt;</strong>/vars"
</pre>

<p>You're all done with the hard part!</p>

<h2>Step 3 &#x2014; Profit!</h2>

<p>Or more accurately: run <code>rigger</code> to provision infrastructure on DigitalOcean and then deploy Deis!</p>

<p>All we need to do is execute:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">./rigger provision
</code></pre></figure>
<div>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you are running Rigger on Mac OS X, you might see the following error message:

</p><pre>
Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.
</pre>

If so, you need to agree to the Xcode license with the `sudo xcodebuild -license` command as mentioned in the Prerequisite section. 

</div>

<p>The Deis provisioning process with Rigger on DigitalOcean takes about 15 minutes and goes like this:</p>

<ol>
<li> <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a> is automatically downloaded and installed into <code>${HOME}/.rigger</code> for use by Rigger</li>
<li> Deis clients (<code>deis</code> and <code>deisctl</code>) are downloaded into <code>${HOME}/.rigger/<strong>&lt;id&gt;</strong>/bins</code></li>
<li> <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a> is used to provision 3 CoreOS Droplets in DigitalOcean</li>
<li> <code>DEISCTL_TUNNEL</code> is determined by investigating one of the newly provisioned DigitalOcean Droplets</li>
<li> <a href="http://xip.io">xip.io</a> is used to set up a simple DNS entry point to the cluster</li>
<li> <code>deisctl install platform</code> is executed</li>
<li> <code>deisctl start platform</code> is executed</li>
</ol>

<div>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If you see the following errors when provisioning the infrastructure on DigitalOcean, make sure your DO Access Token is read-write:

</p><pre>
3 error(s) occurred:

* digitalocean_droplet.deis.1: Error creating droplet: Error creating droplet: API Error: 403 Forbidden
* digitalocean_droplet.deis.0: Error creating droplet: Error creating droplet: API Error: 403 Forbidden
* digitalocean_droplet.deis.2: Error creating droplet: Error creating droplet: API Error: 403 Forbidden
</pre>

You can then run the <code>./rigger provision</code> again. 

</div>

<h2>Step 4 &#x2014; Playtime!</h2>

<p>After you've created your Deis cluster using Rigger, you should deploy an app to it!</p>

<p>First, get back to some free directory space:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">cd ../
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Next, grab an example app from the Deis project:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">git clone https://github.com/deis/example-nodejs-express.git
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Change into the newly created directory:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">cd example-nodejs-express
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Load all the <code>rigger</code> environment variables into this shell:</p>

<pre>
source "${HOME}/.rigger/<strong>&lt;id&gt;</strong>/vars"
</pre>

<p>Then register an administrative account to this Deis cluster:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">deis auth:register http://deis.${DEIS_TEST_DOMAIN}
</code></pre></figure>
<p>You will be prompted for some information to create the account:</p>

<pre>
username: <strong>[ enter a username ]</strong>
password: <strong>[ enter a password ]</strong>
password (confirm): <strong>[ enter the same password ]</strong>
email: <strong>[ enter an email for this user ]</strong>
Registered <strong>&lt;username&gt;</strong>
Logged in as <strong>&lt;username&gt;</strong>
</pre>

<p>Add your public key to the Deis cluster:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">deis keys:add
</code></pre></figure>
<p>You will see the following:</p>

<pre>
Found the following SSH public keys:
1) deiskey.pub deiskey
2) id_dsa.pub sgoings
0) Enter path to pubfile (or use keys:add <key_path>)
Which would you like to use with Deis? <strong>[ enter number ]</strong>
</key_path></pre>

<p>You should pick the public key that goes along with the private key you chose during the <code>rigger configure</code> step.</p>

<p>Add a git remote to point at the Deis cluster:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">deis apps:create
</code></pre></figure>
<p>You will see the following:</p>

<pre>
Creating Application... done, created <strong>hearty-kingfish</strong>
Git remote deis added
remote available at ssh://git@deis.<strong>${DEIS_TEST_DOMAIN}</strong>:2222/<strong>hearty-kingfish</strong>.git
</pre>

<p>Now, push it!</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">git push deis master
</code></pre></figure>
<p>This might take a while. You should eventually see the following at the end of the output:</p>

<pre>
-----&gt; Launching...
 done, <strong>hearty-kingfish</strong>:v2 deployed to Deis

 http://<strong>hearty-kingfish.${DEIS_TEST_DOMAIN}</strong>

 To learn more, use `deis help` or visit http://deis.io
</pre>

<p>Go ahead and load that URL in your browser! (the app is pretty simple, it just prints out: "Powered by Deis")</p>

<h2>Step 5 &#x2014; Knocking it all down!</h2>

<p>Once you've played around with your fancy new Deis cluster a bit... it'd probably be a good idea to tear it all down, eh? That's simple.</p>

<p>Go back to the <code>rigger</code> directory:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">cd ../rigger
</code></pre></figure>
<p>Then, destroy it:</p>
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text">./rigger destroy
</code></pre></figure>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this guide, you were able to see where the Deis team is headed to make the lives of developers, operators, and open source contributors easier. Provisioning a <a href="http://deis.io">Deis</a> cluster is now a breeze with Rigger, thanks to the winning combination of <a href="https://terraform.io">Terraform</a> under the hood and lightning fast DigitalOcean as the infrastructure provider.</p>
