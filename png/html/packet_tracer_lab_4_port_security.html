This access control is mandatory for critical infrastructure protection in your network. It is not on public parts of the network where guest users should be able to connect.</p><p>Port security is a Cisco feature implemented in Catalyst switches which will help network engineers in implementing network security on network boundaries. In its most basic form, the Port Security feature writes the MAC address of the device connected to the switch edge port and allows only that MAC address to be active on that port. If any other MAC address is detected on that port, port security feature shutdown the switch port. The switch can be configured to send a SNMP trap to a network monitoring solution to alert that the port is disabled for security reasons.</p><h2>Lab instructions</h2><p>This lab will test your ability to configure port security on Cisco<sup>TM</sup> 2960 switch interfaces.</p><p>1. Configure port security on interface Fa 0/1 of the switch with the following settings :</p><p>- Port security enabled</p><p>- Mode : restrict</p><p>- Allowed mac addresses : 3</p><p>- Dynamic mac address learning.</p><p>2. Configure port security on interface Fa 0/2 of the switch with the following settings :</p><p>- Port security enabled</p><p>- Mode : shutdown</p><p>- Allowed mac addresses : 3</p><p>- Dynamic mac address learning.</p><p>3. Configure port security on interface Fa 0/3 of the switch with the following settings :</p><p>- Port security enabled</p><p>- Mode : protect</p><p>- Static mac address entry : 00E0.A3CE.3236</p><p>4. From LAPTOP 1 :</p><p>Try to ping 192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1.3. It should work.</p><p>Try to ping 192.168.1.4 and 192.168.1.5. It should work.</p><p>5. Connect ROGUE laptop to the hub.</p><p>Try to ping 192.168.1.1. It should work.</p><p>Try to ping 192.168.1.4. It should fail.</p><h2>Network diagram</h2><p><img src="" border="0" alt="Packet Tracer 5.3 - Port security lab network diagram" title="Packet Tracer 5.3 - Port security lab network diagram"></p><h2>Solution</h2><p><em>Coming soon</em></p></div></article></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>
