Often times when I talk to people who are not familiar with software development and how much an average app costs, I get a myriad of responses between &#x201C;That&#x2019;s awesome!&#x201D; to &#x201C;Unbelievable, that&#x2019;s totally BS.&#x201D; I can&#x2019;t blame the disbelief because I once was on that side as well. Because of that, I decided to write this article after a conversation with my co-founder, Ryan, about the topic. For clarity&#x2019;s sake, I hope this provides a better understanding for those who are new to it.</p><p id="54ae" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">&#x201C;Why do you guys get paid as much as you do?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Why do you charge so much to make an app?&#x201D;</em></p><p id="78bd" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The answer is simple: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">because the job isn&#x2019;t easy</strong>. We as software engineers have to take up a lot of our time to tell stupid things to do incredibly difficult stuff. A good metaphor is like telling an infant to drive along the West Coast using a bus. Computers do not understand English at all, only Binary. Programming languages act more as a translator than an actual language itself. Your English written code is compiled into a low-level language that then translates whatever you write into 1&#x2019;s and 0&#x2019;s for the computer to read. In the real world, all languages function the same way because humans are smart. Before I move on, I must state that programming is very simple: Write instructions. However, by no means is it easy.</p><div id="attachment_3170" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3170 size-large" src="http://www.theglobalfilipino.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/1MoCHSJ14kMLWHYm1GYCsRg-1024x576.jpeg" alt="Photo Cred: Mashable.com" width="1024"><p class="wp-caption-text">Photo Cred: Mashable.com</p></div><p id="ccca" class="graf--p graf-after--p">___________________________________________________________________</p><p id="237c" class="graf--p graf-after--li">___________________________________________________________________</p><p id="58e5" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I do always say this to people who ask how developers earn so much. Software devs get paid large amounts of money because they are enthusiastic about what they do, therefore become very good at it. Usually, that means that they see work and play as one in the same which could be hard to grasp for some people. These software engineers love building things, inventing and pushing the boundaries of software. These guys are usually the ones that come up with breakthrough technology. However, like I said, this will only apply if you genuinely like programming.</p><p id="e055" class="graf--p graf-after--p">If you are considering making an app with a buddy who is already a programmer and just want to see the other side of things, I would give them a hug because as this entire article states, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">it&#x2019;s hard work that people don&#x2019;t notice on the surface. </strong>For those who are considering a switch in your career into tech as a software developer, I ask one question: Do you legitimately like building things? If so, read this article again and ask a programmer how it is like to be one. Also it is important to know that when learning how to program, adopting an engineer&#x2019;s mindset or getting past &#x201C;The Hump&#x201D; as most people describe, it is the hardest part. Now, If your answer is still the same, I urge you to give this a shot. At the end of it all, I hope this gives some perspective into the work that goes with being a software developer.</p><p id="962a" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Special thanks to my co-founder, </em><a class="markup--user markup--p-user" href="https://medium.com/u/bf6e3c44fa0f"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Ryan Bruce Badilla</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> &amp; my good friend, Yi Chin Sun for helping me come up with a lot of the points in this article.</em></p></div></div> </section></div></div>
