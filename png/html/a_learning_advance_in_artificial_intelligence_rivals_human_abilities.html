 </aside><p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-2">The improvements are noteworthy because so-called machine-vision systems are becoming commonplace in many aspects of life, including car-safety systems that detect pedestrians and bicyclists, as well as in video game controls, Internet search and factory robots.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Researchers at the <a title="More articles about the Massachusetts Institute of Technology." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_institute_of_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>, <a title="More articles about New York University." href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/new_york_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org">New York University</a> and the University of Toronto reported a new type of &#x201C;one shot&#x201D; machine learning on Thursday in the journal <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aab3050">Science</a>, in which a computer vision program outperformed a group of humans in identifying handwritten characters based on a single example.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The program is capable of quickly learning the characters in a range of languages and generalizing from what it has learned. The authors suggest this capability is similar to the way humans learn and understand concepts.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The new approach, known as Bayesian Program Learning, or B.P.L., is different from current machine learning technologies known as deep neural networks.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Neural networks can be trained to recognize human speech, detect objects in images or identify kinds of behavior by being exposed to large sets of examples.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Although such networks are modeled after the behavior of biological neurons, they do not yet learn the way humans do &#x2014; acquiring new concepts quickly. By contrast, the new software program described in the Science article is able to learn to recognize handwritten characters after &#x201C;seeing&#x201D; only a few or even a single example.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The researchers compared the capabilities of their Bayesian approach and other programming models using five separate learning tasks that involved a set of characters from a research data set known as Omniglot, which includes 1,623 handwritten character sets from 50 languages. Both images and pen strokes needed to create characters were captured.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">&#x201C;With all the progress in machine learning, it&#x2019;s amazing what you can do with lots of data and faster computers,&#x201D; said Joshua B. Tenenbaum, a professor of cognitive science and computation at <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_institute_of_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the Massachusetts Institute of Technology." class="meta-org">M.I.T.</a> and one of the authors of the Science paper. &#x201C;But when you look at children, it&#x2019;s amazing what they can learn from very little data. Some comes from prior knowledge and some is built into our brain.&#x201D;</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-3">Also on Thursday, organizers of an annual academic <a title="Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2015" href="http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2015/index">machine vision competition</a> reported gains in lowering the error rate in software for finding and classifying objects in digital images.</p><figure id="media-100000004086446" class="media photo embedded has-adjacency layout-large-horizontal media-100000004086446 ratio-tall">

<p class="story-body-text story-content">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m constantly amazed by the rate of progress in the field,&#x201D; said Alexander Berg, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The competition, known as the Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, pits teams of researchers at academic, government and corporate laboratories against one another to design programs to both classify and detect objects. It was won this year by a group of researchers at the <a title="Microsoft Research Asia" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/labs/asia/">Microsoft Research laboratory</a> in Beijing.</p>
 	<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-4">The <a title="More information about Microsoft Corporation" href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/microsoft_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Microsoft</a> team was able to cut the number of errors in half in a task that required their program to classify objects from a set of 1,000 categories. The team also won a second competition by accurately detecting all instances of objects in 200 categories.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-5">The contest requires the programs to examine a large number of digital images, and either label or find objects in the images. For example, they may need to distinguish between objects such as bicycles and cars, both of which might appear to have two wheels from a certain perspective.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-6">In both the handwriting recognition task described in Science and in the visual classification and detection competition, researchers made efforts to compare their progress to human abilities. In both cases, the software advances now appear to surpass human abilities.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">However, computer scientists cautioned against drawing conclusions about &#x201C;thinking&#x201D; machines or making direct comparisons to human intelligence.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">&#x201C;I would be very careful with terms like &#x2018;superhuman performance,&#x2019;&#xA0;&#x201D; said Oren Etzioni, chief executive of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle. &#x201C;Of course the calculator exhibits superhuman performance, with the possible exception of Dustin Hoffman,&#x201D; he added, in reference to the actor&#x2019;s portrayal of an autistic savant with extraordinary math skills in the movie &#x201C;Rain Man.&#x201D;</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The advances reflect the intensifying focus in Silicon Valley and elsewhere on artificial intelligence.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Last month, the Toyota Motor Corporation <a title="Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/technology/toyota-silicon-valley-artificial-intelligence-research-center.html">announced</a> a five-year, billion-dollar investment to create a research center based next to Stanford University to focus on artificial intelligence and robotics.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Also, a formerly obscure academic conference, Neural Information Processing Systems, underway this week in Montreal, has doubled in size since the previous year and has attracted a growing list of brand-name corporate sponsors, including Apple for the first time.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">&#x201C;There is a sellers&#x2019; market right now &#x2014; not enough talent to fill the demand from companies who need them,&#x201D; said Terrence Sejnowski, the director of the <a href="http://cnl.salk.edu">Computational Neurobiology Laboratory</a> at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. &#x201C;Ph.D. students are getting hired out of graduate schools for salaries that are higher than faculty members who are teaching them.&#x201D;</p>
