</p>


<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Mounting_options">Mounting options</span></h2>
<p>I stuck a Ram mount 3" pad to the back of the monitor with foam back mounting tape. So far it's holding on just fine. Now I can mount it to any standard 3/4" ball mount Ram mounts. Probably won't use it on the handlebars of my bike, but I could!! 
</p><p>I thought the little chrome plastic support leg on the back was in the way of the cables, but it just broke off when I was adjusting it! Snap! No more leg problem.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="This_did_not_work">This did not work</span></h3>
<p>I got a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gpscity.com/ram-mount-vehicle-floor-mount-with-octagon-button-end.html">RAM floor mount</a> and adapter today (1/31/12). It's hard to tell what this really is from the pictures. It is just a thick round aluminum rod with a pinch clamp that bolts to one of the seat bracket bolts. 
</p><p>You bolt it to the floor and bend it to get the top end where you want it. Then you slid a piece of flexible plastic tubing over it for aesthetics, clamp another pinch bolt adapter (not included with the arm for some reason) to the top, and you can now use standard RAM ball and socket type parts to attach the monitor.
</p><p>The problems are (1) it gets in the way of the rails on the seat, and (2) the screen vibrates too much. You could hang a mike on it but a display moves around too much when the car is on the road. (Might work in a Coupe Deville. Not in a lowered Yaris.)

<p>If you are using Ubuntu or Debian, the DisplayLink driver (udlfb) is included.
This is great news, makes using DisplayLink far easier than it was a few months ago!

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Step_4.">Step 4.</span></h3>
<p>For Ubuntu
</p><p>In Ubuntu 10.10 there is no fbcon module so I don't need to disable it.
I do have /dev/fb0 and /dev/fb1 devices.
</p><p>After booting today I actually see text on the small monitor. So I am trying to disable that with the kernel boot option in /etc/default/grub
</p><p>The instructions referenced above said to add this line, 
</p>
<pre>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=&#xEF;&#xBF;&#xBD;vga=normal nomodeset&#xEF;&#xBF;&#xBD;
</pre>
<p>but while that did not work on Ubuntu 10.10, this one DID
</p>
<pre>GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=text
</pre>
<p>followed by 'sudo update-grub'
and a reboot, and I now have the much-sought-after GREEN SCREEN. YAY!
</p><p>For Debian,
</p><p>we're still on Grub (not Grub2) so there is no /etc/default/grub file. Directly edit the /boot/grub/menu.lst file -- but -- I already have a green screen on the monitor so I think I am already there.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Step_5.">Step 5.</span></h3>
<p>did the edit
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Step_6.">Step 6.</span></h3>
<p>FAIL -- Ubuntu has no /etc/X11/xorg.conf file! I search and find /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/
</p><p>I find that if I copy the one from the site and put it on Raven, it moves the X11 display to the Lilliput! The 24" monitor goes black. This is WRONG on Raven but would be okay on 8track so I proceed on to moving the monitor over there and start over at step 1...
</p><p>I ended up re-writing my own xorg.conf file for 8track. I won't need any output on the VGA when the system is deployed; it will have only the Lilliput.
</p><p>Now.. the test... restarting gdm, here we go...
Oh. I forgot I don't RUN gdm on 8track! So, exit X11 (Ctl-Alt-Backspace) and run 'startx' again. It fails! There is no 'displaylink' driver found.
</p><p>Get source from <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/">http://projects.unbit.it/downloads/</a>
Install in /usr/local. Try again... works...
</p><p>I will put the xorg.conf file here when it is finalized. I am trying to get the touchscreen to work now.
</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Xorg.conf_debugging_tip">Xorg.conf debugging tip</span></h3>
<ol><li> Get set up with a VGA monitor and the Lilliput. </li>
<li> Run startx to test</li>
<li> Exit with Ctl Alt Backspace</li>
<li> Look at /var/log/X.org.log to see what happened (eg which drivers really loaded)</li>

<p>For the Lilliput UM70 you don't need the driver, usbhid works fine, but the setup.sh file in the driver package will set up xorg.conf for you.
Back up your almost working xorg.conf in case you don't like the results.

(*) Linux driver installer for eGalaxTouch controller 

(I) Check user permission: root, you are the supervisor.
(I) Begin to setup the eGalaxTouch driver.
(I) Extract eGalaxTouch driver archive to /usr/local/eGalaxTouch32.
(I) Create eGalaxTouch utility shortcut in /usr/bin.
(I) Create TKCal tool shortcut in /usr/bin.
(I) Check X window version: 1.10.x
(I) Copy X module: x110/egalax_drv.so to /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input.

(Q) Which interface controller do you use?
(I) [1] RS232 [2] PS/2 [3] USB&#xA0;: '''3'''
(I) Using interface: USB
(I) Found a HID compliant touch controller.

(I) Found X configuration file: /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
(I) Removed touch configuration from /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
(I) Add touch configuration into /etc/X11/xorg.conf.
(I) Copy udev rule: 52-egalax-void.conf to /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d.
(I) Create eGalaxTouch utility shortcut.

(I) Please reboot the system for some changes to take effect.
(I) After booting, type "eGalaxTouch" to do calibration.
</pre>
<p>To disable the mouse device, which fights with the touch screen, add the following new input-device to your xorg.conf:
</p>
<pre> Section "InputDevice"
 Identifier "dummy"
 Driver "void"
 Option "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
 <b>Option "CorePointer"'</b>
 EndSection
</pre>
<p>Note the CorePointer line which forces the dummy device to override the default-pointer. Also I added Option "CoreKeyboard" to the keyboard entry and added this line to "ServerLayout"-section so that the dummy mouse gets added:
</p>
<pre> InputDevice "dummy"
</pre>
<p>This does indeed disable the mouse, I no longer see any stupid frustrating annoying comments about it loading default devices. It has to have a dummy mouse because if you put CorePointer in the touch screen descriptor, it ignores that and still adds the default mouse.
</p><p>From X.org.log
</p>
<pre>(II) LoadModule: "egalax"
(II) Loading /usr/lib/xorg/modules/input//egalax_drv.so
(II) Module egalax: vendor="X.Org Foundation"
 compiled for 1.4.0.90, module version = 3.3.0
 Module class: X.Org XInput Driver
 ABI class: X.Org XInput driver, version 2.0
</pre>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Calibration">Calibration</span></h3>
<p>The latest version of the driver added a calibration program that runs under X11!!! AWESOME, THANKS eGalax people!!!
</p><p>There are many settings in there. It will take some time to figure it all out. 
</p><p>But in the meantime, the Tool-&gt;4pt Calibration worked fine and I now have a usable touchscreen!!
