<strong>And I shouldn't.</strong> Our private moments belong to us. We should never, ever have to worry the government is watching. Yet the NSA is collecting and reviewing our lives every day. Congress will vote by May 22nd to either limit the NSA, or give it even more power. Post to #IFEELNAKED to make Congress ashamed that they’re watching us. We'll <a href="https://www.blackoutcongress.org" target="_blank">present</a> these photos to Congress before that vote and demand they stop.
