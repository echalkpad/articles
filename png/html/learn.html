 <p>So you're ready to learn more about Feathers, eh? If you haven't checked out the <a href="http://feathersjs.com/quick-start/">Quick Start guide</a> head over there first to get a brief intro to the basic parts of a Feathers app. On this page you'll find additional resources and guides how to do more with Feathers.</p>

<h2>API docs</h2>

<p>For the API documentation with detailed information about the Feathers specific API, configuration and to see the changelog and license head over to the <a href="http://feathersjs.com/docs/">Docs</a> page.</p>

<h2>Frontend Frameworks</h2>

<p>Feathers works great with any front-end that connects through HTTP/HTTPS or websockets to your Feathers REST API. Sometimes it is just a few lines of code to make a front-end turn real-time. To help you out we've provided some simple TodoMVC style examples and guides that all connect to the same Feathers real-time API (<a href="http://todos.feathersjs.com">todos.feathersjs.com</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/jquery/">jQuery</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/react/">React</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/angularjs/">Angular</a></li>
<li><a href="http://feathersjs.github.io/todomvc/feathers/canjs/">CanJS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>We don't know all the frameworks out there so if you don't see your favourite, submit an issue or - even better - a pull request and we'll try our best to make it happen.</p>

<h2>Databases</h2>

<p>Feathers already has plug-ins for <em>Create, Read, Update and Delete</em> operations on many different databases. All plug-ins provide a common way to filter, sort and limit records, which makes switching between databases super easy. Our <a href="http://feathersjs.com/learn/mongodb">MongoDB guide</a> goes into a bit more detail on how to use Feathers with MongoDB (<strong>spoiler:</strong> it's only 16 lines of code to build a complete REST and real-time API with a MongoDB backend). For more information about other databases visit their own plug-in page:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-memory">In memory</a> - A service that stores everything locally in memory. Probably not ideal in production environments but great for prototyping.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-mongodb">MongoDB</a> - A basic MongoDB implementation, easy to use.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-mongoose">Mongoose</a> - Support for the MongoDB ODM which gives you schemas and validation out of the box.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-nedb">NeDB</a> - A file based database similar to MongoDB. Great if you want to ship your application and use it without having to set up a datbase server.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-sequelize">MySQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-sequelize">PostgreSQL</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-sequelize">SQLite</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-sequelize">MariaDB</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-sequelize">MSSQL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are wondering how to customize those existing adapters and make it easier to switch between different databases, read more about hooks in the next paragraph.</p>

<h2>Hooks and validation</h2>

<p>While not part of the core, <a href="https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers-hooks">feathers-hooks</a> is a powerful plugin that allows to customize service method execution with small pluggable, reusable Lego-pieces very similar to Express middleware. We created a <a href="http://feathersjs.com/learn/validation/">guide how to use hooks for validation</a> and you can read more about the theory and patterns behind it <a href="https://medium.com/all-about-feathersjs/api-service-composition-with-hooks-47af13aa6c01">in this blog post</a>.</p>

<h2>Authentication</h2>

<p>Since Feathers directly extends Express you can use any of its authentication mechanism. The <a href="http://feathersjs.com/learn/authentication">Authentication Guide</a> describes more specifically how to set up shared authentication between HTTP and websockets using PassportJS, sessions and a service for managing users.</p>

<h2>Authorization</h2>

<p>Once set up with user authentication, our <a href="http://feathersjs.com/learn/authorization">Authorization Guide</a> talks about how to use hooks for user authorization and how to dispatch real-time events only to specific authenticated users.</p>
