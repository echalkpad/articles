<p>The installation and editing processes seem to be happening at lightning speed, but you will find yourself creating pages at the very same pace in no time at all. Perform a design function once or twice, and you are well on your way to becoming an expert.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the tools you have to work with, like the <b>Admin Panel</b> and the <b>Layout Configurator</b>, keep track of your design efforts, so you never have to go back because you&#x2019;ve lost track of where you are or what you did. Be Theme does that for you, as you move along a click at a time. The video offers just a small sampling of how easy this WordPress theme is to use.</p>
