<p>Apple <a title="OS X 10.9 Mavericks: Everything you need to know" href="http://www.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/os-x-10-9-mavericks-everything-you-need-to-know/">just launched OS X Mavericks as a free update</a> for most Mac users who are running at least OS X 10.6.8 Snow Leopard. Ever since OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, those major new OS X versions were only made available as a download via the Mac App Store. You simply can&#x2019;t buy them on physical media anymore.</p>
<p>In some cases, you may want to create a bootable USB OS X install drive. This has been a rather easy task in the past. Well, it has gotten a bit harder this time around.<br>
<br>
Here&#x2019;s what you will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a Mac with access to the Internet and to the Mac App Store</li>
<li>a USB flash drive with 8GB or more (note that everything on that drive will be erased during this process!)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&#xA0;Step 1: Download the OS X Mavericks installation app</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-App-Store-download.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1636" alt="OS X Mavericks App Store download" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-App-Store-download.png" width="1198"></a></figure>
<p>Open the Mac App Store on your Mac and <a title="OS X Mavericks in the App Store" href="https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/os-x-mavericks/id675248567?l=en&amp;mt=12">find the OS X Mavericks page to download the installation app</a>. Downloading the app may take a while since it&#x2019;s roughly around 5.2GB in size.</p>
<p>You may proceed with step 2 while the app is still downloading:</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Make hidden files viewable on your Mac</strong></p>
<p>Open Finder, go to Applications, open the Utilities folder and double click on the Terminal app.</p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Terminal-window.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1637" alt="Terminal window" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Terminal-window.png" width="894"></a></figure>
<p>Copy and paste the following into the Terminal window, then hit enter to make all hidden files viewable:</p>
<p><em>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE &amp;&amp; killall Finder</em></p>
<p><em></em>Further down this post, I will show you how to hide those files again.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Open the OS X Mavericks installation app</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Show-Pakage-Contents.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1638" alt="OS X Mavericks Show Pakage Contents" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Show-Pakage-Contents.png" width="915"></a></figure>
<p>Once the download is finished, open Finder, go to Applications, right click on the &#x201C;Install OS X Mavericks&#x201D; app and then click on &#x201C;Show Package Contents&#x201D;.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Find the InstallESD.dmg file</strong></p>
<p>In this step, you need to activate the InstallESD.dmg image file by double clicking on it.</p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-InstallESD-DMG.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1639" alt="OS X Mavericks InstallESD DMG" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-InstallESD-DMG.png" width="921"></a></figure>
<p>The File can be found under Contents -&gt; SharedSupport in the just opened package contents of the OS X Mavericks installation app.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Find the BaseSystem.dmg file</strong></p>
<p>By double clicking on the aforementioned InstallESD.dmg file, a new window should open.</p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Install-ESD.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1640" alt="OS X Mavericks Install ESD" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Install-ESD.png" width="884"></a></figure>
<p>In that window, find the BaseSystem.dmg file. Note that the file will look grayed out since it&#x2019;s a hidden file.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Open Disk Utility</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>In the Utilities folder that you have opened in step 2, find the Disk Utility app and open it by double clicking on it.</p>
<p>Insert your USB thumb drive into your Mac.</p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Disk-Utility-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1642" alt="OS X Mavericks Disk Utility 1" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Disk-Utility-1.png" width="1397"></a></figure>
<p>Now, drag the BaseSystem.dmg file from step 5 into the left list of drives in Disk Utility.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7: Start copying onto the USB drive</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Disk-Utility-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1643" alt="OS X Mavericks Disk Utility 2" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/OS-X-Mavericks-Disk-Utility-2.png" width="904"></a></figure>
<p>In Disk Utility, click on your USB drive&#x2019;s partition, then click on &#x201C;Unmount&#x201D; in tool bar (the blue and white button right next to the famous black and yellow Burn button).</p>
<p>Now, click on BaseSystem.dmg in the drive list and drag you USB drive (8.03GB SanDisk Cruzer M, in my case) into the Destination field in the Restore panel.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;re ready to start copying, click on Restore in the lower right hand side.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8: Delete Packages alias</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Delete-Packages-Alias.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1644" alt="Delete Packages Alias" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Delete-Packages-Alias.png" width="807"></a></figure>
<p>Go to Finder, look for the USB drive you&#x2019;ve just created, find System -&gt; Installation and delete the Packages file (alias).</p>
<p><strong>Step 9: Copy the actual Packages folder</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Copy-actual-Packages-folder-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1646" alt="Copy actual Packages folder 1" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Copy-actual-Packages-folder-1.png" width="1293"></a></figure>
<p>Open another Finder window by selecting a Finder window and then clicking cmd + N. Find the OS X Install ESD image that you&#x2019;ve opened previously. From there, copy the Packages folder to the Installation folder on your USB drive (right where you just deleted the alias file in step 8).</p>
<p>Note that this step will take a while.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10: Hide hidden files again</strong></p>
<figure><a href="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Hide-hidden-Files-in-OS-X.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1647" alt="Hide hidden Files in OS X" src="http://cdn.tips-and-tricks-in-mavericks.com/images/2013/10/Hide-hidden-Files-in-OS-X.png" width="684"></a></figure>
<p>Open Terminal (see step 2) and copy and paste the following, then hit enter:</p>
<p><em>defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles FALSE &amp;&amp; killall Finder</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 11: Install OS X Mavericks from your USB drive</strong></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s it: your USB drive is now ready to be used to install OS X Mavericks from it.</p>
<p>Make sure you insert your USB drive, restart your Mac and press the alt key once your hear the sound when your Mac is booting up.</p>

Note that it involves some interaction with the root shell, so it&#x2019;s <strong>not recommended for the less tech-savvy folks</strong> out there.</p>
