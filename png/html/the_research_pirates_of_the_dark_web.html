 <h3 class="hed">Donald Trump and the Twilight of White America</h3>
 </a>
 

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">Racial resentment and economic anxiety are not separate forces. For many Trump supporters, they are inextricably linked.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p class="dropcap">On June 25, 2015, a week after Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States, the Census Bureau released a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-25/american-babies-are-no-longer-mostly-non-hispanic-white">landmark report</a> on the demographics of American children under the age of five. For the first time in U.S. history, it reported that a minority of this group is &#x201C;white&#x201D;&#x2014;neither black, nor Asian, nor Hispanic.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">The notion of America&#x2019;s ethnic majority has been dubious for a long time. What today many people call &#x201C;white&#x201D; is really a catch-all for various European groups once seen as racially distinct. But this report threw the entire concept into chaos. &#x201C;A majority of American babies are now minorities,&#x201D; Bloomberg <a href="https://www.google.fr/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-0cnQwdbMAhVM1hoKHY7IAKoQFggmMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F2015-06-25%2Famerican-babies-are-no-longer-mostly-non-hispanic-white&amp;usg=AFQjCNHx3KmA-49R5zb0ydzno6u_C2B7dA">reported</a>, somewhat paradoxically. In a country where most people are minorities, the majority does not exist. Even within the headline, the word <em>majority</em> is collapsing in on itself.</p>&#13;

 <h3 class="hed">The Lie of Trump's 'Self-Funding' Campaign</h3>
 </a>
 

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">Pundits are calling foul on the presumptive Republican nominee for starting to court donors, but he&#x2019;s depended on donations and loans to himself all along.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p>Throughout the fall and winter, a favorite media narrative was to link Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump together, two outsiders who were upending their respective parties&#x2019; races by blasting donor-driven big-money politics. Sanders has kept to that rhetoric into the spring, making the recitation of his famous $27 average donation a centerpiece of every stump speech. But for Trump, it has turned out to be just that: rhetoric.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>With the Republican nomination all but secured, Trump has changed his tune for the general election. Trump is suddenly looking to build a major fundraising operation, complete with donors and super PACs, rather than self-funding, as he&#x2019;s boasted time and again that he is doing.</p>&#13;

 <h3 class="hed">The Partnership Between Colleges and Helicopter Parents</h3>
 </a>
 

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">Many public universities now rely heavily on parents&#x2014;particularly those with money, time, and connections&#x2014;to meet their basic needs.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p>A few days after dropping off her youngest child at college, Andrea got a phone call. The wounds in her daughter&#x2019;s mouth from a recent wisdom-tooth surgery had gone septic. Andrea drove there immediately, located an oral surgeon in town, booked a room at the university hotel, and put her daughter to bed to recover. The next morning, Andrea went to her daughter&#x2019;s classes, taking notes on her behalf. It was important to Andrea, a professor, and her husband, an MBA, that their daughter head into the first semester of college without missing a beat: A future dental career required four years of a stellar undergraduate academic record.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>At the same time, another parent faced a different type of problem. Alexis had handpicked her daughter&#x2019;s new university specifically for its Greek life, big-time sports, and array of not particularly challenging majors. She and her husband, a CFO of a major Fortune 500 company, were intent on giving their daughter the ideal social experience in college. But when she got there, she seemed not to hit her stride. Alexis blamed it on a working-class roommate who &#x201C;didn&#x2019;t ever want to go out [and] meet people&#x201D;&#x2014;and told her daughter, in no uncertain terms, to change roommates. Alexis also shipped bags of designer clothes to help her child fit in with affluent sorority members.</p>&#13;

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">Food customization is more than a craze in America&#x2014;it's a reflection of identity.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p>It&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/picture-galleries/11375182/Revealed-The-drinks-you-didnt-know-you-could-order-at-Starbucks.html">been said</a> that there are 87,000 ways to order a drink at Starbucks.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>You&#x2019;ve got your non-fat milk, full-fat milk, soy milk, and coconut milk; espresso shots; all the different flavored syrups, some of which are sugar-free; whipped cream; iced, hot, or &#x201C;extra hot&#x201D; if you&#x2019;ve got a Kevlar tongue; different sizes; different roasts of coffee; and on and on and on.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Surely some of those combinations are gross&#x2014;Venti green tea latte with peppermint and whipped cream, anyone?&#x2014;but you can have them if you want them. And as Sophie Egan, a program director at the Culinary Institute of America, writes in her new book<a href="http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062390981"> <em>Devoured</em></a>, that speaks to &#x201C;a most American element of the American food psyche&#x201D;: customization.</p>&#13;

 <h3 class="hed">The Donors Who Love Bernie Sanders A Little Too Much</h3>
 </a>
 

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">The FEC has notified the campaign that thousands of its 2.4 million contributors may be violating federal limits.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p>Bernie Sanders has become known for his legions of diehard supporters, millions of whom have flooded his campaign with small-donor contributions. Yet many of those fans, it turns out, have become a little <em>too</em> supportive of the Vermont senator&#x2019;s presidential bid.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>For months, the Federal Election Commission has been writing to the Sanders campaign with warnings that hundreds of his donors have exceeded the $2,700 contribution limit and that hundreds more may be foreign nationals illegally giving Sanders money. The <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/847/201605100300045847/201605100300045847.pdf">most recent, and by far the longest, letter</a> came on Tuesday and flagged more than 1,500 questionable donors.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Other campaigns this year have also struggled to track their donors and make sure they are contributing within federal limits. Ted Cruz and Ben Carson also received multiple letters from the FEC flagging hundreds of potentially excessive donors. And in 2008, so did Barack Obama, who, like Sanders, relied on the grassroots support from millions of small-dollar contributors. But the sheer volume of potential violations by the Sanders campaign&#x2014;the list flagged by the FEC ran 639 pages&#x2014;appears to be unprecedented, and it suggests that the campaign&#x2019;s operation has been unable to effectively manage its army of donors.</p>&#13;

 <p class="dek">Many low-income shoppers, a study finds, miss out on the savings that come with making purchases in bulk.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p dir="ltr">&#x201C;One of the great ironies in modern America,&#x201D; writes Mehrsa Baradaran in her 2015 book <em>How the Other Half Banks</em>, &#x201C;is that the less money you have, the more you pay to use it.&#x201D; Baradaran, an associate professor at the University of Georgia&#x2019;s law school, was referring to the outrageously high fees that low-income workers must pay to &#x201C;fringe&#x201D; banks just to access and manage the money they&#x2019;ve earned.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">Her point&#x2014;that when people don&#x2019;t have much, a single dollar in some ways doesn&#x2019;t go as far as it otherwise would&#x2014;extends to several other parts of Americans&#x2019; financial lives, including how they shop.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p dir="ltr">In <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2742431">a recent working paper</a>, the University of Michigan&#x2019;s A. Yesim Orhun and Mike Palazzolo, point to how two of American shoppers&#x2019; (and marketers&#x2019;) favorite money-saving strategies, the limited-time offer and buying in bulk, come with savings that are more accessible to some consumers than others. Choosing to buy things when they&#x2019;re on sale or packaged in huge quantities is something lots of shoppers may take for granted as a matter of preference, but for many, these purchases&#x2014;and the savings that come with them&#x2014;are out of reach.</p>&#13;

 <h3 class="hed">The Oldest Person in the World and the Secret to Her Longevity</h3>
 </a>
 

 <div class="article-content ">
 <p class="dek">Emma Morano, 116, is believed to be the last person alive<strong> </strong>born in the 1800s.</p>
 
 <div class="excerpt">
 <p>The oldest person in the world <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/05/13/worlds-oldest-person-dies-new-york-age-116/84319294/">died Thursday night</a> in New York, and that title passed to Emma Morano, who at 116 is believed to be the last person alive<strong> </strong>born in the 1800s.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>Morano lives in the Italian mountain town of Verbania, and she was born November 29, 1899. She has seen her country transition from a constitutional monarchy to a republic. She&#x2019;s lived through two wars and two decades of Fascism. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/world/raw-eggs-and-no-husband-since-38-keep-her-young-at-115.html">In 2015 she told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> about her secret to longevity:&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>&#13;
&#13;
<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Ms. Morano has no doubts about how she made it this long: Her elixir for longevity consists of raw eggs, which she has been eating &#x2014; three per day &#x2014; since her teens when a doctor recommended them to counter anemia. Assuming she has been true to her word, Ms. Morano would have consumed around 100,000 eggs in her lifetime, give or take a thousand, cholesterol be damned.</p>&#13;
&#13;
<p>She is also convinced that being single for most of her life, after an unhappy marriage that ended in 1938 following the death of an infant son, has kept her kicking. Separation was rare then, and divorce became legal in Italy only in 1970. She said she had plenty of suitors after that, but never chose another partner. &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t want to be dominated by anyone,&#x201D; she said.</p>&#13;
