<p>Hillary Clinton doesn&#x2019;t usually get much love from the hacker elite. This is a presidential candidate, after all, whose idea of securing classified emails was to keep them on a <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/03/clintons-email-server-vulnerable/">server in her basement</a>, and when asked if she&#x2019;d &#x201C;wiped&#x201D; that computer, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/18/hillary-clinton-wont-say-if-her-server-was-wiped/" target="_blank">responded</a> &#x201C;with a cloth or something?&#x201D; But in an election year when her opponent is Donald Trump&#x2014;and a group of very active Russian cyberspies whom Trump has publicly encouraged&#x2014;Clinton has scored a surprising first: a hacker fundraiser.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas, Clinton backers held a political event that was unprecedented for one of the biggest hacker gatherings in the world, inviting attendees to an evening of drinks at Vegas&#x2019; Mandalay Bay hotel and casino with a minimum donation of $100 to the Clinton campaign. Though Clinton herself didn&#x2019;t attend, several dozen people packed into the small Mexican restaurant where the fundraiser was held anyway, many giving the maximum legal donation of $2,700, according to the fundraiser&#x2019;s organizer, former Obama administration official Jake Braun. And from Braun&#x2019;s opening remarks, he used the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/hack-brief-russias-breach-dnc-trumps-dirt/" target="_blank">Russian breach of the Democratic National Committee revealed last month</a> and Trump&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/07/trump-invites-russian-cyber-spying-unprecedented-remarks/" target="_blank">recent invitation for those Russian hackers to leak Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s emails</a> as a rallying cry for Clinton, and a point against a candidate with a dangerous ignorance of cybersecurity issues.</p>
<p>&#x201C;The Russians have hacked the elections in Georgia and Kygyrzstan and the Ukraine. Who&#x2019;s to say they&#x2019;re not going to do it here? I mean, my god, they already have,&#x201D; Braun, a political consultant, Obama campaign staffer, and former White House liaison to the Department of Homeland Security, told the small crowd. &#x201C;We all know this. We need to make sure the world knows this, and that Donald Trump and his affiliates know it&#x2019;s not OK to tell the Russians they can come and hack our democracy.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Among the attendees in the political event&#x2019;s audience were Facebook chief security officer Alex Stamos and Chris Wysopal, the founder of security firm Veracode and a member of the legendary hacker collective the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/2015/06/22/net-of-insecurity-part-3/" target="_blank">L0pht</a>. Later, Jeff &#x201C;The Dark Tangent&#x201D; Moss, founder of both the Black Hat conference and the much larger hacker conference Defcon, made his own remarks in support of Clinton at the start of the two hour event.</p>
<p>&#x201C;I swore an oath to uphold the Constitution, and what&#x2019;s happening is really fucking scary,&#x201D; Moss told the small crowd, referring to a position he&#x2019;s held since 2009 on the advisory council of the Department of Homeland Security. Moss acknowledged that holding a political event at Black Hat had generated controversy among the gathering&#x2019;s typically nonpartisan crowd. He said he&#x2019;d received a flood of emails, about one in four of which attacked him for politicizing the conference&#x2014;despite Black Hat&#x2019;s official insistence that the private fundraiser was held independently from the conference itself. &#x201C;One friend asked me, &#x2018;If Trump held an event, would you speak at that?&#x2019; If the Republicans had a cybersecurity policy, I&#x2019;d seriously consider it,&#x201D; Moss added, describing himself as an independent. &#x201C;But they don&#x2019;t have a policy. They don&#x2019;t have a platform. And they don&#x2019;t have anything organized.&#x201D;</p>



<p>It wasn&#x2019;t only former democratic officials who spoke up at the event; so did Jason Healey, a former cybersecurity advisor to George W. Bush&#x2019;s White House. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m a technocrat. I care about seeing the right things get done,&#x201D; Healey said. &#x201C;But in this election, you can&#x2019;t sit back and say anymore that whoever the president&#x2019;s going to be, I&#x2019;ll serve them. It&#x2019;s time to get involved in the campaign.&#x201D;</p>
<p>In any other election, it&#x2019;s difficult to imagine even a small group of Black Hat&#x2019;s attendees coming together to so vehemently support any political candidate or party. And Clinton&#x2019;s campaign statements haven&#x2019;t always ingratiated her to the hacker world: She&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/hillary-clinton-is-wrong-about-edward-snowden" target="_blank">denied that NSA leaker Edward Snowden was a whistleblower</a> and said she believes he should return to the US to face legal charges. And she&#x2019;s called for a &#x201C;Manhattan Project&#x201D; to create an encryption technique that would <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/12/hillary-clinton-wants-manhattan-like-project-to-break-encryption/" target="_blank">allow law enforcement access to Americans&#x2019; communications</a>, placing herself in opposition to most encryption experts who see any such crypto backdoor as a critical flaw in data protections.</p>
<p>But Trump has made a series of statements that have been far more frightening and appalling for many in the cybersecurity and national security communities. Last month he repeated to the <em>New York Times</em> his <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/22/us/politics/donald-trump-foreign-policy-interview.html?_r=0" target="_blank">threat not to help protect members of the NATO treaty</a> from invasion from foreign powers like Russia. MSNBC <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/trump-asks-why-us-cant-use-nukes-msnbcs-joe-scarborough-reports.html" target="_blank">reports</a> he&#x2019;s repeatedly asked advisors why the U.S. shouldn&#x2019;t use its nuclear arsenal.</p>
<p>After Russian hackers were revealed to have breached the Democratic National Committee last month, Trump&#x2019;s glib request to the hackers to leak Clinton&#x2019;s deleted emails from her time as Secretary of State earned him another level of disdain from cybersecurity experts. And Braun, the organizer of Clinton&#x2019;s Black Hat fundraiser, says he saw an opportunity to refocus his efforts to assemble support from the cybersecurity community around that remark. &#x201C;Donald Trump and Russia are my best fundraising tools ever,&#x201D; Braun told WIRED.</p>
