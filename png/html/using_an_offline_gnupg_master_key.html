 <p>OpenPGP subkeys have many benefits (well summarized on this <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Subkeys">Debian wiki page</a>), one of
them being that if you have both an encryption subkey and a signing
subkey (at least), you don&#x2019;t need your master private key for your daily
usage of OpenPGP&#x2014;you will only need it for signing someone else&#x2019;s key or
to modify your own key (adding or revoking User IDs, adding or revoking
subkeys, updating the preferences, etc.).</p>
 <p>Consequently, your private master key can be put offline most of the
time, and brought back to your computer only on those few occasions
where it is required.</p>
 <p>There are already <a href="https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair/">many</a>
<a href="http://wiki.fsfe.org/Card_howtos/Card_with_subkeys_using_backups#Removing_the_master_key_from_the_keyring">pages</a>
on the web describing how to do that. However, most of them, if not all
of them, predate the recent release of GnuPG 2.1, so I thought an update
on that topic would be worthwhile.</p>
 <h2>How to remove the master private key from your keyring</h2>
 <h3>Step 1: Back up the original keyring</h3>
 <p>Let&#x2019;s assume you have the following private keyring:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --list-secret-keys</strong>
/home/alice/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
sec rsa4096/CB2F38F25B491A54 2014-12-31 [SC] [expires: 2017-12-30]
uid [ultimate] Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;
ssb rsa2048/04BB7F8FDEC5E5D9 2014-12-31 [S] [expires: 2015-12-31]
ssb rsa2048/BBB6B86627C2D43A 2014-12-31 [E] [expires: 2015-12-31]</pre>
 <p>Export the private master key and its private subkeys:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --armor --output alice-private-keys.asc --export-secret-key alice@example.org</strong></pre>
 <p>Store the exported private keys in a secure place (not on your
computer). You may also print a hardcopy with a tool like <a href="http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/">Paperkey</a>:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --export-secret-key alice@example.org | paperkey | lpr</strong></pre>
 <h3>Step 2: Remove the private master key from the keyring</h3>
 <p>The &#x201C;classic&#x201D; method for doing that is to export your private
subkeys, then delete all your private keys (the master private key and
the private subkeys), and import back the private subkeys (because GnuPG
prior to version 2.1 had no option to delete the master key only).</p>
 <p>With GnuPG 2.1 however, there is a more direct method. First, find
the <em>keygrip</em> of your master key:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --list-secret-keys --with-keygrip</strong>
/home/alice/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
sec rsa4096/CB2F38F25B491A54 2014-12-31 [SC] [expires: 2017-12-30]
 Keygrip = <em>D4DF0C35D3E22FA6AC37DA2E54FB03F73616A3CB</em>
uid [ultimate] Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;
ssb rsa2048/04BB7F8FDEC5E5D9 2014-12-31 [S] [expires: 2015-12-31]
 Keygrip = 21B2EDF018D7CAF0B45644FDB753DD42307C4425
ssb rsa2048/BBB6B86627C2D43A 2014-12-31 [E] [expires: 2015-12-31]
 Keygrip = 2E149DA9C5E46E0DECC6A17EFD8B5FB1DF1E1BAB</pre>
 <p>Then send a <code>DELETE_KEY</code> command to the GnuPG Agent:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg-connect-agent "DELETE_KEY D4DF0C35D3E22FA6AC37DA2E54FB03F73616A3CB" /bye</strong></pre>
 <p>Confirm that you want to delete the key when the agent ask you
so.</p>
 <div class="note">
 <p>For reference, the &#x201C;classic&#x201D; method (which still works with GnuPG
 2.1) is as follows:</p>
 <p>First, export the subkeys:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --armor --output private-subkeys.asc --export-secret-subkeys alice@example.org</strong></pre>
 <p>Then delete the private master key and its subkeys:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --delete-secret-key alice@example.org</strong>

sec rsa4096/CB2F38F25B491A54 2014-12-31 Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;

Delete this key from the keyring? (y/N) <strong>y</strong>
This is a secret key! - really delete? (y/N) <strong>y</strong></pre>
 <p>Then import back the subkeys you have just exported:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --import private-subkeys.asc</strong>
gpg: key CB2F38F25B491A54: "Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;" not changed
gpg: key CB2F38F25B491A54: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 4
gpg: unchanged: 1
gpg: secret keys read: 4
gpg: secret keys imported: 2</pre>
 </div>
 <h3>Step 3: Ensure that the private master key has been removed</h3>
 <p>List the contents of your private keyring again:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --list-secret-keys</strong>
/home/alice/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
------------------------------
sec# rsa4096/CB2F38F25B491A54 2014-12-31 [SC] [expires: 2017-12-30]
uid [ultimate] Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;
ssb rsa2048/04BB7F8FDEC5E5D9 2014-12-31 [S] [expires: 2015-12-31]
ssb rsa2048/BBB6B86627C2D43A 2014-12-31 [E] [expires: 2015-12-31]
ssb rsa2048/7D2233B8833E70AF 2014-12-31 [A] [expires: 2015-12-31]</pre>
 <p>No matter which method above you have used, you should see the
<code>#</code> symbol after the <code>sec</code> keyword, confirming
that the private master key is not usable.</p>
 <p>If you want to be really sure, try to do something that requires the
private master key, such as adding a new dummy User ID to your
keyring:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --edit-key alice@example.org</strong>
Secret key is available.

 <h2>How to use the offline master key</h2>
 <p>There are several ways to make GnuPG temporarily use the offline
master key. The method I am currently using goes along the following
lines.</p>
 <p>Let&#x2019;s assume you have stored the <code>alice-private-keys.asc</code>
file (generated in step 1 above) on a USB stick, and that, when the
stick is mounted, the file is available at a location such as
<code>/run/media/alice/mystick/alice-private-keys.asc</code>.</p>
 <p>Create a temporary directory to use as a temporary GnuPG home:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>mkdir ~/gpgtmp</strong>
$ <strong>chmod 0700 ~/gpgtmp</strong></pre>
 <p>Import your complete private keyring on that directory from your
backup file:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --homedir ~/gpgtmp --import /run/media/alice/mystick/alice-private-keys.asc</strong>
gpg: keybox &#x2018;gpgtmp/pubring.kbx&#x2019; created
gpg: gpgtmp/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created
gpg: key 5B491A54: public key "Alice &lt;alice@example.org&gt;" imported
gpg: key 5B491A54: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 4
gpg: imported: 1
gpg: secret keys read: 4
gpg: secret keys imported: 3</pre>
 <p>You may now unmount your USB stick and put it back in its safe
place.</p>
 <p>Now edit the key you want to sign. Use the temporary directory as
GnuPG home, but add the public keyring from your normal GnuPG home
directory:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg2 --homedir ~/gpgtmp --keyring ~/.gnupg/pubring.kbx --edit-key bob@example.com</strong></pre>
 <div class="note">
 <p>If you were using GnuPG 2.0 prior to GnuPG 2.1, your public keyring
 is probably still in the &#x201C;legacy&#x201D; format and will be called
 <code>pubring.gpg</code> instead of <code>pubring.kbx</code>.</p>
 </div>
 <p>When you have finished, terminate the GnuPG Agent which was started
in the temporary directory, and wipe out that directory:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gpg-connect-agent --homedir ~/gpgtmp KILLAGENT /bye</strong>
$ <strong>rm -rf ~/gpgtmp</strong></pre>
 <p>A drawback of this method is that since you are not using your normal
GnuPG&#x2019;s home directory, any configuration file in that directory will be
ignored. If that is a concern, you may copy or symlink your
<code>$GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf</code> file into the temporary directory
before invoking GnuPG.</p>
 <p>I strongly suggest using a small script to automatize the above
commands&#x2014;such as this one&#x200B;<sup><a class="footnote-call" href="http://www.incenp.org/notes/2015/using-an-offline-gnupg-master-key.html#footnote1" id="fcall1">1</a></sup>:</p>
 <pre class="file">#!/bin/bash

# The DOS label of your USB stick
LABEL=mystick

# The pathname to the file containing your private keys
# on that stick
KEYFILE=alice-private-keys.asc

# Identify the device file corresponding to your USB stick
device=$(/sbin/findfs $LABEL)

if [ -n "$device" ]; then
 # Mount the stick
 udisksctl mount --block-device $device

 # Create temporary GnuPG home directory
 tmpdir=$(mktemp -d -p $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR gpg.XXXXXX)

 # Import the private keys
 gpg2 --homedir $tmpdir --import /run/media/$USER/$LABEL/$KEYFILE

 # Unmount the stick
 udisksctl unmount --block-device $device

 # Launch GnuPG from the temporary directory,
 # with the default public keyring
 # and with any arguments given to us on the command line
 gpg2 --homedir $tmpdir --keyring ${GNUPGHOME:-$HOME/.gnupg}/pubring.kbx $@

 # Cleaning up
 [ -f $tmpdir/S.gpg-agent ] &amp;&amp; gpg-connect-agent --homedir $tmpdir KILLAGENT /bye
 rm -rf $tmpdir
fi</pre>
 <h2>Some further thoughts</h2>
 <h3>Splitting the master key in parts</h3>
 <p>If you don&#x2019;t like the idea to keep your offline master key on a
single USB stick,<sup><a class="footnote-call" href="http://www.incenp.org/notes/2015/using-an-offline-gnupg-master-key.html#footnote2" id="fcall2">2</a></sup> you may want to use a <em>N-of-M secret sharing scheme</em> to
split the backup file in <em>M</em> parts, in such a way that <em>N</em>
parts at least are needed to reconstruct the file.</p>
 <p>For example, using <a href="http://www.digital-scurf.org/software/libgfshare">libgfshare</a>&#x2019;s
implementation of <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=359168.359176">Shamir&#x2019;s
 Secret Sharing Scheme</a>:</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>gfsplit -n 2 -m 3 alice-private-keys.asc</strong></pre>
 <p>This will produce three files of the form
<code>alice-private-keys.asc.NNN</code>, any two of which will be needed
to reconstruct the original file. You may then store each of them on a
different support.</p>
 <h3>Another method: Manipulating GnuPG Agent&#x2019;s key files directly</h3>
 <p>Currently (with GnuPG 2.1), GnuPG Agent stores each private key in a
separate file <code>$GNUPGHOME/private-keys-v1.d/NNN&#x2026;NNN.key</code>,
where <em>NNN&#x2026;NNN</em> is the 20-bytes long keygrip of the key.</p>
 <p>This allows a different and much simpler method to put the master
private key offline, and bringing it back only when needed.</p>
 <p>Back up the private key and delete it from the private keyring in a
single step simply by moving the corresponding file from the
<code>$GNUPGHOME/private-keys-v1.d</code> directory (once you know its
keygrip):</p>
 <pre class="console">$ <strong>mv ~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/D4DF0C35D3E22FA6AC37DA2E54FB03F73616A3CB.key \
 /run/media/alice/mystick/</strong></pre>
 <p>To use the master key when needed, copy or symlink it from your
storage device back into the private keys directory, perform the
operation requiring the master key, then delete the file or symlink. No
more need to use a temporary GnuPG home directory.</p>
 <div class="note">
 <p>A few remarks regarding this method:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>the private key is stored in its protected form, so it is as
 well protected using this method as it was using the
 <code>--export-secret-key</code> option above;</li>
 <li>GnuPG Agent only caches the passphrase protecting the key, never
 the key itself&#x2014;it reads the key from file everytime the key is
 required, which means that as soon as the key file is removed from
 the agent&#x2019;s directory, the key is no longer available;</li>
 <li>a possible cause of concern is that this method depends on what
 may be considered as implementation details of GnuPG Agent, which
 may very well change in future GnuPG versions&#x2014;by contrast the first
 method above only depends on GnuPG&#x2019;s public interface.</li>
 </ul>
