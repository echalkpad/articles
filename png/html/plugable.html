<ul><li>&#x201C;Awesome Productivity Tool&#x2026;Video is so important to me, that I didn&#x2019;t even experiment &#x2013; I just did it. This thing just works. I&#x2019;m so, sooo very happy. Thank you Plugable. We&#x2019;re BFFs for life, now.&#x201D;- Daniel Digriz, Oklahoma City, OK</li>
<li>&#x201C;I like this so much, I&#x2019;m probably going to get another external monitor for my setup, and run it off of yet another one of these Plugable USB-VGA devices.&#x201D; &#x2013; J. Lunt, Chicago, IL</li>
<li>&#x201C;This is a great little gadget and was worth every penny I paid for it. &#x201D; &#x2013; P. Moulder, Ohio</li>

<p>We often hear customers say &#x201C;After using multiple monitors, I can&#x2019;t go back!&#x201D;. If you&#x2019;re doing information work &#x2014; looking at one document while editing another, researching, or generally working on several things at once &#x2014; it&#x2019;s indispensable. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-multiple-monitor-problems"><img src="http://res1.windows.microsoft.com/resbox/en/Windows%20Vista/main/f/7/f7bb8d3d-c6db-458b-b045-03ab98eb9db2/f7bb8d3d-c6db-458b-b045-03ab98eb9db2.gif"></a></p>
<p>Simply drag windows back and forth to make use of all the extra Windows desktop space. </p>
<p>Plugable USB graphics adapters fully support rotation &#x2014; turn one or both screens to show documents in gorgeous full-page layout (with a monitor stand that&#x2019;s capable of rotation). </p>
<p>A common setup is to create a beautifully symmetric yet flexible 3 display desktop, combining your laptop display with 2 extra monitors on either side with your laptop&#x2019;s external graphics port + one Plugable adapter, or with two Plugable adapters to allow easy USB dock/undock.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Requirements and Recommendations</strong></p>
<ul><li>CPU: Dual-core or 2GHz processor or better recommended on Windows Vista, Win7, and Mac (Single core ULV or Intel Atom class processors or better are recommended for Windows XP and Linux)</li>
<li>GPU: Used for 2D/3D rendering on Windows Vista and Win7, requiring a single Intel, nVidia, or ATI primary WDDM driver.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Driver and OS Version details</strong></p>
<div>See the <a target="_blank" href="http://displaylinkmanuals.s3.amazonaws.com/DisplayLinkUserManual5.6.pdf">DisplayLink User Manual</a> for full details and setup tips</div>
<p>WINDOWS VERSION COMPATIBILITY:<br>
Drivers are provided automatically via Microsoft&#x2019;s Windows Update mechanism with approved drivers across all of Windows XP, Vista, and Windows 7. 64-bit and full Aero support on Vista and Windows 7. Windows XP 64-bit not supported. Note that Microsoft limits multiple display support in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/compare">Windows 7 &#x201C;Starter&#x201D; Edition</a> and <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/products/compare">Windows Vista &#x201C;Home Basic&#x201D; Edition</a> to mirroring screens.</p>
<p>For Windows Server 2003 (32-bit), Server 2008 (32 and 64-bit) and Server 2008 R2 (64-bit) you will need to download the drivers from the <a href="http://displaylink.com/support/downloads.php">DisplayLink website</a>. </p>
<p>MAC VERSION COMPATIBILITY:<br>
Up to 4 DisplayLink devices can be used with a Mac.</p>
<p>DisplayLink&#x2019;s Mac driver v. 1.7 for OS X Lion 10.7, Snow Leopard 10.6, Leopard 10.5, and Tiger 10.4 is available at <a href="http://displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php">http://displaylink.com/support/mac_downloads.php</a>. DisplayLink notes the following limitation: &#x201C;This driver does not support 3D acceleration. Some features of Mac OS X-based applications that require hardware OpenGL acceleration, such as Keynote presentations and iPhoto slideshows, will not function properly.&#x201D;</p>
<p>The latest recommended version of Mac OS X is 10.7.2. Although 10.7.3 was released in February 2012, there is a bug with display rotation that affects third-party drivers. We do not recommend using 10.7.3 until DisplayLink is certain that display-management issues in this OS X release have been fixed.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://displaylink.com/mac">http://displaylink.com/mac</a> for more info</p>
<p>LINUX COMPATIBILITY:<br>
As of Linux kernel 2.6.31, this adapter has open source drivers in the kernel staging tree. As of 2.6.38, the driver was promoted to the main kernel tree. Configuration of X Windows for USB displays is still distribution and scenario dependent, however, and only for very adventurous users. Plugable is involved with Linux development work, see <a href="http://plugable.com/category/platform/linux/">http://plugable.com/category/platform/linux/</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Resolutions Supported</strong></p>
<p>The hardware is capable of supporting nearly arbitrary resolutions, up to its limit of 1920&#xD7;1080 (widescreen) and 1600&#xD7;1200 (standard). Additional VESA standard and widescreen resolutions are supported by most software, including:</p>
<p>1920&#xD7;1080, 1600&#xD7;1200, 1680&#xD7;1050, 1400&#xD7;1050, 1280&#xD7;1024, 1280&#xD7;768, 1152&#xD7;864, 1024&#xD7;768, 800&#xD7;600, 640&#xD7;480</p>
<p>With 16 and 32bpp color depths. Some operating systems require specific depths, like 32bpp for Windows Aero support.</p>
<p><strong>Performance Tuning</strong><br></p><p>A USB graphics adapter is a &#x201C;virtual&#x201D; device that uses your machine&#x2019;s CPU and memory to render graphics. It then transfers just the pixels that change over the USB 2.0 cable to the device. The screen itself is refreshed continually (60 times a second) by hardware over the monitor&#x2019;s own cable, from memory on the device.
</p><ul><li>When nothing on a USB screen is changing, the PC is doing little or no work and nothing is going over USB. Meanwhile, the screen continues to refresh directly from the device.</li>
<li>However, when most pixels on the screen is changing, your CPU is doing the heavy lifting, and also the (480Mbs) USB 2.0 bus can become a bottleneck. You may start to notice lags in mouse or window movements.</li>
</ul><p>If you&#x2019;re experiencing slowness or latency on your USB display:
</p><ul><li>Reduce your screen resolution with the operating system display control panel.</li>
<li>Play 3D games and videos on your primary (non-USB) screen.</li>
</ul><p>By reducing the amount of data that needs to be compressed and sent over USB, you&#x2019;ll increase responsiveness.</p>
