 <p>This is part one of a <strike>three</strike>four-part series introducing &#x2018;functional&#x2019; programming in JavaScript. In this article we take a look at the building blocks that make JavaScript a &#x2018;functional&#x2019; language, and examine why that might be useful.</p>



<h2 id="whatthefunc">What the Func?</h2>

<p>What is all the hype about Functional JavaScript? And why is it called <em>functional</em>? It&#x2019;s not as though anyone sets out to write <em>dys</em>functional or non-functioning Javascript. What is it good for? Why would you bother?</p>

<p>To me, learning functional programming is a little bit like <a href="http://youtu.be/4yr_etbfZtQ">getting a Thermomix</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes a bit of up-front investment;</li>
<li>You&#x2019;ll start telling all your friends and family about it how awesome it is; and</li>
<li>They start to wonder if you&#x2019;ve joined some kind of cult.</li>
</ul>

<p>But, it does make certain tasks a whole lot easier. It can even automate certain things that would otherwise be fairly tedious and time-consuming.</p>

<h2 id="buildingblocks">Building Blocks</h2>

<p>Let&#x2019;s start with some of the basic features of JavaScript that make &#x2018;functional&#x2019; programming possible, before we move on to why it&#x2019;s a good idea. In JavaScript we have two key building blocks: <em>variables</em> and <em>functions</em>. Variables are sort-of like containers that we can put things in. You can create one like so:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var myContainer = "Hey everybody! Come see how good I look!";
</code></pre>

<p>That creates a container called <code>myContainer</code> and sticks a string in it.</p>

<p>Now, a function, on the other hand, is a way to bundle up some instructions so you can use them again, or just keep things organised so you&#x2019;re not trying to think about everything all at once. One can create a function like so:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function log(someVariable) {
 console.log(someVariable);
 return someVariable;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you can call a function like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">log(myContainer);
// Hey everybody! Come see how good I look!
</code></pre>

<p>But, the thing is, if you&#x2019;ve seen much JavaScript before, then you&#x2019;ll know that we could also write and call our function like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var log = function(someVariable) {
 console.log(someVariable);
 return someVariable;
}

log(myContainer);
// Hey everybody! Come see how good I look!
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#x2019;s look at this carefully. When we write the function definition this way, it looks like we&#x2019;ve created a variable called <code>log</code> and stuck a function in it. And that&#x2019;s exactly what we have done. Our <code>log()</code> function <em>is</em> a variable; which means that we can do the same things with it that we can do with other variables.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s try it out. Could we, maybe, pass a function as a parameter to another function?</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var classyMessage = function() {
 return "Stay classy San Diego!";
}

log(classyMessage);
// [Function]
</code></pre>

<p>Hmmmm. Not super useful. Let&#x2019;s try it a different way.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var doSomething = function(thing) {
 thing();
}

var sayBigDeal = function() {
 var message = "I&#x2019;m kind of a big deal";
 log(message);
}

doSomething(sayBigDeal);
// I&#x2019;m kind of a big deal
</code></pre>

<p>Now, this might not be terribly exciting to you, but it gets computer scientists quite fired up. This ability to put functions into variables is sometimes described by saying &#x201C;functions are first class objects in JavaScript.&#x201D; What that means is just that functions (mostly) aren&#x2019;t treated differently to other data types like objects or strings. And this one little feature is surprisingly powerful. To understand why though, we need to talk about DRY code.</p>

<h2 id="dontrepeatyourself">Don&#x2019;t Repeat Yourself</h2>

<p>Programmers like to talk about the DRY principle&#x2014;Don&#x2019;t Repeat Yourself. The idea is that if you need to do the same set of tasks many times, bundle them up into some sort of re-usable package (like a function). This way, if you ever need to tweak that set of tasks, you can do it in just one spot.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s look at an example. Say we wanted to put three carousels on a page using a carousel library (an imaginary library for the sake of example):</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var el1 = document.getElementById('main-carousel');
var slider1 = new Carousel(el1, 3000);
slider1.init();

var el2 = document.getElementById('news-carousel');
var slider2 = new Carousel(el2, 5000);
slider2.init();

var el3 = document.getElementById('events-carousel');
var slider3 = new Carousel(el3, 7000);
slider3.init();
</code></pre>

<p>This code is somewhat repetitive. We want to initialise a carousel for the elements on the page, each one with a specific ID. So, let&#x2019;s describe how to initialise a carousel in a function, and then call that function for each ID.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function initialiseCarousel(id, frequency) {
 var el = document.getElementById(id);
 var slider = new Carousel(el, frequency);
 slider.init();
 return slider;
}

initialiseCarousel('main-carousel', 3000);
initialiseCarousel('news-carousel', 5000);
initialiseCarousel('events-carousel', 7000);
</code></pre>

<p>This code is clearer and easier to maintain. And we have a pattern to follow: when we have the same set of actions we want to take on different sets of data, we can wrap those actions up in a function. But what about if we have a pattern where the action changes?</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">var unicornEl = document.getElementById('unicorn');
unicornEl.className += ' magic';
spin(unicornEl);

var fairyEl = document.getElementById('fairy');
fairyEl.className += ' magic';
sparkle(fairyEl);

var kittenEl = document.getElementById('kitten');
kittenEl.className += ' magic';
rainbowTrail(kittenEl);
</code></pre>

<p>This code is a little bit trickier to refactor. There is definitely a repeated pattern, but we&#x2019;re calling a different function for each element. We could get part of the way there by wrapping the <code>document.getElementById()</code> call and adding the <code>className</code> up into a function. That would save us a little bit of repetition:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function addMagicClass(id) {
 var element = document.getElementById(id);
 element.className += ' magic';
 return element;
}

var unicornEl = addMagicClass('unicorn');
spin(unicornEl);

var fairyEl = addMagicClass('fairy');
sparkle(fairyEl);

var kittenEl = addMagicClass('kitten');
rainbow(kittenEl);
</code></pre>

<p>But we can make this even more DRY, if we remember that JavaScript lets us pass functions as parameters to other functions:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function addMagic(id, effect) {
 var element = document.getElementById(id);
 element.className += ' magic';
 effect(element);
}

addMagic('unicorn', spin);
addMagic('fairy', sparkle);
addMagic('kitten', rainbow);
</code></pre>

<p>This is much more concise. And easier to maintain. The ability to pass functions around as variables opens up a lot of possibilities. In the next part we&#x2019;ll look at using this ability to make working with arrays more pleasant.</p>
