 <p>This month marks the one-year anniversary of Firefox Developer Edition. To celebrate, we&#x2019;re excited to show you some new tools &#x2013; and some improvements to existing tools &#x2013; that let you work with the Web in a visual and intuitive way.</p>

<p>As the Web becomes a more dynamic, interactive and mobile experience, visual designers are more than ever experimenting with animation &#x2013; and the latest Firefox Developer Edition has tools to make working with animations faster and easier. Firefox Developer Edition now gives visual designers and animators a set of visual editing tools that work like they do. We are addressing the technically challenging aspects of animation with a set of visceral, powerful, interactive tools that are comfortable for designers to use. Visual editing tools should appeal to animators, not just to programmers.</p>
<h2>DevTools Challenger</h2>
<p>Reading about our new tools is great, but trying them out yourself is even better! To help you get started, we partnered with acclaimed Web animation engineer and advocate <a href="http://rachelnabors.com/" target="_blank">Rachel Nabors</a> to create <a href="http://devtoolschallenger.com/" target="_blank">DevTools Challenger</a>. Check out DevTools Challenger for hands-on exercises with all of our new visual design tools. Remember to keep scrolling until you get to the ocean floor!</p>

<h2>Animation &amp; CSS Filter Tools</h2>
<p>The Page Inspector&#x2019;s animation panel makes it easy to scrub, pause, and visualize each animation on a webpage. Thanks to its tight integration in the DOM inspector, you can switch between a global view of every animation, or drill down to just a few nodes.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/11/animationtools.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-29431" src="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/11/animationtools.png" alt="animationtools" width="2096"></a></p>
<p>Once you&#x2019;ve found the animation you want, our visual cubic-bezier editor is just a click away. Packed with useful presets, the editor will ensure your animation moves perfectly.</p>

<p>We&#x2019;ve also built a similar editor for CSS filters, allowing you to visually add, remove, re-order, and adjust filters with live feedback from the page.</p>

<h2>Measurements &amp; Colors</h2>
<p>Firefox Developer Edition also features two brand new tools for fine-tuning layout: you can now enable pixel rulers along the page margins, or use our new measurement tool to drag-and-measure arbitrary regions of the page.</p>
<p><a href="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/11/measuretools1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29432 size-large" src="https://2r4s9p1yi1fa2jd7j43zph8r-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/files/2015/11/measuretools1-500x344.png" alt="" width="500"></a></p>
<p>The Inspector now defaults to displaying CSS colors &#x201C;as authored,&#x201D; and shift-clicking on a color swatch cycles between authored styles and equivalent hex, rgb, and hsl values. There&#x2019;s even an eyedropper tool to pick colors right from the page.</p>
<h2>Memory Snapshots</h2>
<p>The new Memory tool helps front-end engineers better understand and optimize the way pages allocate and retain memory. The tool works by taking a snapshot of the heap, then allows you to drill down by retained object type, allocation stack, or internal representation. We think you&#x2019;ll like it, and we&#x2019;ve got many more features and enhancements in the works!</p>

<h2>WebSocket Debugging API</h2>
<p>Lastly, we&#x2019;re extremely excited to announce that Firefox now exposes an API for monitoring WebSocket frames (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1203802" target="_blank">Bug 1203802</a>), which is the first step on the path to a full-fledged WebSocket inspection tool. Developer Tools engineer Jan Odvarko has built <a href="https://github.com/firebug/websocket-monitor/wiki" target="_blank">an experimental add-on</a> for inspecting WebSocket traffic. Install the add-on and give it a try, we&#x2019;d love your feedback.</p>
