<h3><strong>The Unofficial Goldman Sachs guide to being a man:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Stop talking about where you went to college.</li>
<li>Always carry cash. Keep some in your front pocket.</li>
<li>Rebel from business casual. Burn your khakis and wear a suit or jeans.</li>
<li>It&#x2019;s ok to trade the possibility of your 80s and 90s for more guaranteed fun in your 20s and 30s.</li>
<li>Never stay out after midnight three nights in a row&#x2026; Unless something really good comes up on the third night.</li>
<li>You will regret your tattoos.</li>
<li>Never date an ex of your friend.</li>
<li>Join Twitter; become your own curator of information.</li>
<li>If riding the bus doesn&#x2019;t incentivise you to improve your station in life, nothing will.</li>
<li>Time is too short to do your own laundry.</li>
<li>When the bartender asks, you should already know what you want to drink.</li>
<li>If you perspire, wear a damn undershirt.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Hookers aren&#x2019;t cool, but remember, the free ones are a lot more expensive.</li>
<li>When people don&#x2019;t invite you to a party, you really shouldn&#x2019;t go.&#x2028; And sometimes even when you are invited, you shouldn&#x2019;t go.</li>
<li>People are tired of you being the funny, drunk guy.</li>
<li>When in doubt, always kiss the girl.</li>
<li>Tip more than you should.</li>
<li>You probably use your mobile phone too often and at the wrong moments.</li>
<li>Buy expensive sunglasses. Superficial? Yes, but so are the women judging you. And it tells these women you appreciate nice things and are responsible enough not to lose them.</li>
<li>Do 50 push-ups, sit-ups, and dips before you shower each morning.</li>
<li>Eat brunch with friends at least every other weekend. Leave Rusty and Junior at home.</li>
<li>Be a regular at more than one bar.</li>
<li>Act like you&#x2019;ve been there before. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it&#x2019;s in the end zone at the Super Bowl or on a private plane.</li>
<li>A glass of wine or two with lunch will not ruin your day.</li>
<li>Learn how to fly-fish.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>No selfies. Aspire to experience photo-worthy moments in the company of a beautiful woman.</li>
<li>Own a handcrafted shotgun. It&#x2019;s a beautiful thing.</li>
<li>There&#x2019;s always another level. Just be content knowing that you are still better off than most who have ever lived.</li>
<li>You can get away with a lot more if you&#x2019;re the one buying the drinks.</li>
<li>Ask for a salad instead of fries.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t split a check.</li>
<li>Pretty women who are unaccompanied want you to talk to them.</li>
<li>When a bartender buys you a round, tip double.</li>
<li>Be spontaneous.</li>
<li>Find a Times New Roman in the streets and a Wingdings in the sheets. She exists.</li>
<li>Piercings are liabilities in fights.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Do not use an electric razor.</li>
<li>Desserts are for women. Order one and pretend you don&#x2019;t mind that she&#x2019;s eating yours.</li>
<li>Buy a tuxedo before you are 30. Stay that size.</li>
<li>One girlfriend at a time is probably enough.</li>
<li>#StopItWithTheHastags</li>
<li>Your ties should be rolled and placed in a sectioned tie drawer.</li>
<li>Throw parties. &#x2028;But have someone else clean up the next day.</li>
<li>Measure yourself only against your previous self.</li>
<li>Take more pictures. With a camera.</li>
<li>Place-dropping is worse than-name dropping.</li>
<li>Your clothes do not match. They go together.</li>
<li>Yes, of course you have to buy her dinner.</li>
<li>&#xA0;Staying angry is a waste of energy.</li>
<li>If she expects the person you are 20% of the time, 100% of the time, then she doesn&#x2019;t want you.</li>
<li>Always bring a bottle of something to the party.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t use the word &#x201C;closure&#x201D; or ever expect it in real life.</li>
<li>If you are wittier than you are handsome, avoid loud clubs.</li>
<li>Date women outside your social set. You&#x2019;ll be surprised.</li>
<li>If it&#x2019;s got velvet ropes and lines, walk away unless you know someone.</li>
<li>You cannot have a love affair with whiskey because whiskey will never love you back.</li>
<li>If you believe in evolution, you should know something about how it works.</li>
<li>No-one cares if you are offended, so stop it.</li>
<li>Never take an ex back. She tried to do better and is settling with you.</li>
<li>Eating out alone can be magnificent. Find a place where you can sit at the bar.</li>
<li>Read more. It allows you to borrow someone else&#x2019;s brain, and will make you more interesting at a dinner party &#x2014; provided that you don&#x2019;t initiate conversation with, &#x201C;So, who are you reading&#x2026;&#x201D;</li>
<li>Ignore the boos. They usually come from the cheap seats.</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t ever say, &#x201C;it is what it is.&#x201D;</li>
<li>Don&#x2019;t gamble if losing $US100 is going to piss you off.</li>
<li>Remember, &#x201C;rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men.&#x201D;</li>
