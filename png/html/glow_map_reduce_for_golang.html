<p>Having been a Java developer for many years, I have simply lost
interest in Java and want to code everything in Go, mostly due to
Go&#x2019;s simplicity and performance. But it&#x2019;s Java that is having fun in
the party of big data. Go is sitting alone as a wall flower. There
is no real map reduce system for Go, until now!</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/chrislusf/glow">Glow</a> is aiming to be a simple
and scalable map reduce system, all in pure Go. Not only the system
setup is simple and scalable, but also writing and running the map
reduce code.</p>

<p>Glow also provides <a href="https://github.com/chrislusf/glow/wiki#glow-apis">Map()/Filter()/Reduce() functions</a>, which works
well in standalone mode. It&#x2019;s totally fine to just run in standalone
mode. Let&#x2019;s face it, very often you do not have that much data that
has to run on a distributed system. Glow can fully utilize Go&#x2019;s
efficiency and goroutines to process fairly large amount of data.
And if you really need to scale up, you can scale up with Glow by
by running it in distributed mode.</p>

<p>This time I will cover:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a simple word count in standalone mode.</li>
<li>Setup the distributed system.</li>
<li>Run the word count in distributed mode.</li>
<li>Process data on Hdfs and mongodb, and input and output data via Go channels.</li>
</ol>

<p>People already read about Glow can skip to section 4 for a more
realistic use case.</p>

<h2 id="boring-word-count:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Boring Word Count</h2>

<p>In distributed computing, the equivilent of hello word is a word
count:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
 "strings"

 "github.com/chrislusf/glow/flow"
)

func main() {
 flow.New().TextFile(
 "/etc/passwd", 3,
 ).Filter(func(line string) bool {
 return !strings.HasPrefix(line, "#")
 }).Map(func(line string, ch chan string) {
 if strings.HasPrefix(line, "#"){
 return
 }
 for _, token := range strings.Split(line, ":") {
 ch &lt;- token
 }
 }).Map(func(key string) int {
 return 1
 }).Reduce(func(x int, y int) int {
 return x + y
 }).Map(func(x int) {
 println("count:", x)
 }).Run()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we load the &#x201C;/etc/passwd&#x201D; file and partitioned into 3 shards.
Each shard is processed by 1 filter, 2 mappers, reduced to one
count, and printed out via a mapper.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s run this file:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run t.go
count: 532
</code></pre>

<p>I hope you like the code here. It may not look as simple as other
languages that are skipping data types. But when a project gets
reasonably large, readability is a big deal. Glow&#x2019;s anonymous
functions have the right amount of type information, which helps to
understand the code, especially when someone else wrote it.</p>

<p>If you do not have much data now, you can actually stop here and run
Glow in standalone mode. Glow&#x2019;s API works for both standalone
mode and distributed mode. I highly encourage you start using Glow
in standalone mode. It should just work.</p>

<h2 id="go-channels-in-glow:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Go channels in Glow</h2>

<p>Glow works natually with channels. The data flows from one dataset
to the next dataset via channels, either in standalone mode or
distributed mode.</p>

<p>Another interesting usage of channel is that a channel can be a
mapper&#x2019;s result emitter. Usually 1 mapper emits 1 result, which
can be represented as function&#x2019;s return result, e.g.,
<code>func(key string) int</code>. But if a mapper can emit 0 or more
than 1 result, this won&#x2019;t work. The channel fits nicely here. If the
last parameter of a mapper funtion is a channel, e.g.,
<code>func(line string, ch chan string)</code>, it will be treated
as the result emitter.</p>

<h2 id="setup-glow-cluster:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Setup Glow Cluster</h2>

<p>Now let us setup the Glow cluster, just in case you need to scale up.
Setting up Glow Cluster is super easy. First, build the &#x201C;glow&#x201D; binary file:</p>

<pre><code>$ go get github.com/chrislusf/glow
</code></pre>

<p>The compiled binary file is usually <code>$GOPATH/bin/glow</code>.
Now copy it to any computer, and run this:</p>

<pre><code>// start a master on one computer
&gt; glow master
// run one or more agents on computers
&gt; glow agent --dir ./glow/data --max.executors=16 --memory=2048 --master="localhost:8930" --port 8931
// it's fine to run several agents on the same computer
&gt; glow agent --dir ./glow/data2 --max.executors=8 --memory=512 --master="localhost:8930" --port 8932
</code></pre>

<p>Either master or agent only takes 5~6 MB memory. They are quiet
and efficient. I highly recommend run this &#x201C;glow agent&#x201D; on any
machine you can find, so that you can tap into the compute power any
time you want, with one line of code change as follows.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-execution:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Distributed Execution</h2>

<p>Just insert this line to the import section, around line 7:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"> _ "github.com/chrislusf/glow/driver"
</code></pre>

<p>Now the word count can run distributedly this way:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run t.go -glow
2015/12/08 00:54:46 localhost:8930 allocated 1 executors.
2015/12/08 00:54:46 localhost:8930 allocated 1 executors.
2015/12/08 00:54:46 localhost:8930 allocated 2 executors.
2015/12/08 00:54:46 localhost:8930 allocated 1 executors.
127.0.0.1:8931&gt;count: 532
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you can visualize the flow. Run this command:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run t.go -glow -glow.flow.plot &gt; x.dot
$ dot -Tpng -owc.png x.dot
</code></pre>

<p>And the flow graph looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.gopheracademy.com/postimages/advent-2015/glow-word-count-flow.png" alt="Word Count Flow">
</p>

<h2 id="something-wrong:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Something wrong!</h2>

<p>You may get a different result when running distributedly vs
standalone! This is because I cheated!</p>

<p>The input file &#x201C;/etc/passwd&#x201D; could be different on different servers.
The file should be sent to the executor that&#x2019;s running the
TextFile() function. Let&#x2019;s change the TextFile() call to this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go"> TextFile("passwd", 3)
</code></pre>

<p>And make sure the file is shipped to the executor:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run t.go -glow -glow.related.files="/etc/passwd"
...
127.0.0.1:8931&gt;count: 532
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, still many things can break when it comes to
distributed mode. We need to understand how Glow works first.</p>

<h2 id="glow-underneath:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Glow Underneath</h2>

<h2 id="how-glow-works:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">How Glow works?</h2>

<p>The word count code looks simple, but does many things. It can act as either a driver or an executor depending on command line
parameters.</p>

<p>When the driver starts, it will ask the Glow master for resources.
The master knows the system&#x2019;s resource usage by the heartbeats from
the Glow agents. The master will assign agents to the driver when
available. By design, the Glow distributed system theorectically can
run even with just one executor.</p>

<p>Then for each task, the driver would contact the assigned agents,
and send a binary clone of itself, but run in executor mode. The
driver will also tell the executor the input data locations.</p>

<p>Started by the agents, the executor will pull the data via network
channels, process it, and write output to local agent.</p>

<p>The driver can send and receive data to the executors via network
channels also.</p>

<h2 id="code-structure:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Code structure</h2>

<p>For many simple cases, the word count example is enough. However,
in order to run the code as either driver or executor, this structure
is recommended.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
 "flag"

 _ "github.com/chrislusf/glow/driver"
 "github.com/chrislusf/glow/flow"
)


var (
 f1 = flow.New()
 f2 = flow.New()

 // input or output channel if any
 inputChan = make(chan InputType)
 outputChan = make(chan OutputType)
)

func init() {
 // flow definitions
 f1.Channel(inputChan).Map(...).Reduce(...).AddOutout(outputChan)
 f2.Slice(...).Map(...).Reduce(...)
}

func main() {
 // these 2 lines are needed
 // to differentiate executor mode and driver mode.
 // Just always add them.
 flag.Parse()
 flow.Ready()

 // start the flow
 go f1.Run()

 // feed into input channel if any
 ...

 // wait for the output channel if any
 ...

 // possibly start other flow
 f2.Run()
}

</code></pre>

<p>So basically 2 things to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li>the <code>flag.Parse()</code> and <code>flow.Ready()</code> need to
be called after the main() starts.</li>
<li>the flow definitions should be inside <code>init()</code></li>
</ol>

<h2 id="why-define-flows-in-init:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Why define flows in init()?</h2>

<p>It is worth noting that I declared the flow definition in init()
function.</p>

<p>This is because Go currently lacks the capability to dynamically
compile and load a piece of code. This impacts the design of Glow.
In distributed mode, Glow needs to send the compiled binary to Glow
Agents, and then run the binary in executor mode by adding flow id
and task id to existing command line options.</p>

<p>To achieve this correctly, the flows should be statically
deterministic. The flows and the flow steps should not change given
the same command line parameters.</p>

<p>Go&#x2019;s init() is an ideal place to cleanly define flows, in one or
multiple files.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-make-flows-dynamically:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">How to make flows dynamically?</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the flows are static. How to dynamically change
the flow?</p>

<p>Actually we do not change flows. We can just define multiple flows,
and dynamically invoke a flow based on the results coming out of the
flow via channels.</p>

<p>The flow definitions can be thought as machines. Your code can have
many machines, defined in several files&#x2019; init() functions.
Depending on your situation, you can start a machine, feed it via
Go&#x2019;s channels, and read the output also via Go&#x2019;s channels.</p>

<p>A typical example would be running Linear Regression until the error
is small enough. The error can be sent back to the driver, and the
driver can decide whether it needs to run one more round of
regression.</p>

<h2 id="a-more-real-example:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">A more real example</h2>

<p>Let&#x2019;s assume you have a folder of log access files on hdfs, and want
to join it with a Mongodb database of user accounts, to find out
the most active user age group. The expected output is pairs of
<code>age range ~ access count</code>.</p>

<p>Let&#x2019;s define the data types first. In Glow, the data between each
steps are in common Go types. For current example, the overly
simplified types for log line and user account are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type LogLine struct {
 Page string
 UserId int
}
type UserAccount struct {
 UserId int
 Age int
}
</code></pre>

<p>Go&#x2019;s strict type system is one of my favorite Go features. This would
make refactoring super easy. When there are lots of data processing
flows, detecting schema changes during compile time is invaluable.</p>

<p>We will use Go&#x2019;s channels to feed data from the driver to the
executors, and read the outputs out also via channels.</p>

<p>However, the log files usually are fairly large. It&#x2019;s not efficient
to read all data to the driver, and scatter them out to the cluster.
Instead, we will just use the driver to list files under the
folder, and send the list of files via channel to the executors.
Each executor will pull its own input data from hdfs. This is
<a href="https://github.com/chrislusf/glow/blob/master/source/hdfs/hdfs.go#L16">implemented in the <code>hdfs.Source</code> function</a>.</p>

<p>We will read the data from Mongodb from an executor.</p>

<p>Here is the complete source code.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

var (

func init() {

<p>Assume the file is x.go. Similarly, just run this in standalone mode:</p>

<pre><code>$ go run x.go
</code></pre>

<p>Run in distributed mode:</p>

<p>Generate the flow diagram:</p>

<h2 id="final-words:fba516203a27e034a54ec0b318ef96f7">Final words</h2>

<p>Glow is simple, but powerful. Setting up a Glow cluster is super
easy. A simple piece of code is all you need to run distributedly.</p>

<p>Conceptually, we just use Go&#x2019;s channels to connect to a flow.</p>

<p>Glow has many components underneath. But the code is fairly easy to
read, with potential to improve or customize. I welcome everyone to
start using it and welcome any improvements.</p>

<p>Glow&#x2019;s APIs, e.g., Map()/Reduce()/Filter() functions, can be used in
standalone mode also. It makes code easy to read and write. This
could also be quite useful.</p>

<p>Golang&#x2019;s channel is an ideal model for moving data along the
processing system. Glow currently works with batch proccesing, and
may support stream processing in the future.</p>

<p>Glow also need to add monitoring, fault tolerant error handling, etc.
Lots of work to be done. Welcome to any kind of contribution!</p>
