<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Normalize.css is an alternative to CSS resets. The project is the product of
100&#x2019;s of hours of extensive research by <a href="https://twitter.com/necolas">@necolas</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/jon_neal">@jon_neal</a> on the differences between
default browser styles.</p>
<p>The aims of normalize.css are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preserve useful browser defaults</strong> rather than erasing them.</li>
<li><strong>Normalize styles</strong> for a wide range of HTML elements.</li>
<li><strong>Correct bugs</strong> and common browser inconsistencies.</li>
<li><strong>Improve usability</strong> with subtle improvements.</li>
<li><strong>Explain the code</strong> using comments and detailed documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It supports a wide range of browsers (including mobile browsers) and includes
CSS that normalizes HTML5 elements, typography, lists, embedded content, forms,
and tables.</p>
<p>Despite the project being based on the principle of normalization, it uses
pragmatic defaults where they are preferable.</p>
<h2 id="normalize-vs-reset">Normalize vs Reset</h2>
<p>It&#x2019;s worth understanding in greater detail how normalize.css differs from
traditional CSS resets.</p>
<h4 id="normalize-css-preserves-useful-defaults">Normalize.css preserves useful defaults</h4>
<p>Resets impose a homogenous visual style by flattening the default styles for
almost all elements. In contrast, normalize.css retains many useful default
browser styles. This means that you don&#x2019;t have to redeclare styles for all the
common typographic elements.</p>
<p>When an element has different default styles in different browsers,
normalize.css aims to make those styles consistent and in line with modern
standards when possible.</p>
<h4 id="normalize-css-corrects-common-bugs">Normalize.css corrects common bugs</h4>
<p>It fixes common desktop and mobile browser bugs that are out of scope for
resets. This includes display settings for HTML5 elements, correcting
<code>font-size</code> for preformatted text, SVG overflow in IE9, and many form-related
bugs across browsers and operating systems.</p>
<p>For example, this is how normalize.css makes the new HTML5 <code>search</code> input type
cross-browser consistent and stylable:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">

<span class="tag">input</span><span class="attr_selector">[type="search"]</span> <span class="rules">{
 <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-appearance</span>:<span class="value"> textfield</span></span>; 
 <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-moz-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> content-box</span></span>;
 <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> content-box</span></span>; 
 <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">box-sizing</span>:<span class="value"> content-box</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span>



<span class="tag">input</span><span class="attr_selector">[type="search"]</span><span class="pseudo">::-webkit-search-decoration</span>,
<span class="tag">input</span><span class="attr_selector">[type="search"]</span><span class="pseudo">::-webkit-search-cancel-button</span> <span class="rules">{
 <span class="rule"><span class="attribute">-webkit-appearance</span>:<span class="value"> none</span></span>;
<span class="rule">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Resets often fail to bring browsers to a level starting point with regards to
how an element is rendered. This is particularly true of forms &#x2013; an area
where normalize.css can provide some significant assistance.</p>

<p>A common irritation when using resets is the large inheritance chain that is
displayed in browser CSS debugging tools.</p>

</figure>

<p>This is not such an issue with normalize.css because of the targeted styles and
the conservative use of multiple selectors in rulesets.</p>
<h4 id="normalize-css-is-modular">Normalize.css is modular</h4>
<p>The project is broken down into relatively independent sections, making it easy
for you to see exactly which elements need specific styles. Furthermore, it
gives you the potential to remove sections (e.g., the form normalizations) if
you know they will never be needed by your website.</p>
<h4 id="normalize-css-has-extensive-documentation">Normalize.css has extensive documentation</h4>
<p>The normalize.css code is based on detailed cross-browser research and
methodical testing. The file is heavily documented inline and further expanded
upon in the <a href="https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/wiki">GitHub Wiki</a>. This
means that you can find out what each line of code is doing, why it was
included, what the differences are between browsers, and more easily run your
own tests.</p>
<p>The project aims to help educate people on how browsers render elements by
default, and make it easier for them to be involved in submitting improvements.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-normalize-css">How to use normalize.css</h2>
<p>First, install or <a href="http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/">download
normalize.css</a> from GitHub. There are
then 2 main ways to make use of it.</p>
<p>Approach 1: use normalize.css as a starting point for your own project&#x2019;s base
CSS, customising the values to match the design&#x2019;s requirements.</p>
<p>Approach 2: include normalize.css untouched and build upon it, overriding the
defaults later in your CSS if necessary.</p>

<p>Normalize.css is significantly different in scope and execution to CSS resets.
It&#x2019;s worth trying it out to see if it fits with your development approach and
preferences.</p>
<p>The project is developed in the open on GitHub. Anyone can report issues and
submit patches. The full history of the project is available for anyone to see,
and the context and reasoning for all changes can be found in the commit
messages and the issue threads.</p>
