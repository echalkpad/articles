<p score="7.0"><aside class="manual-ad right" score="1.25"></aside>Like all of the scattered recollections I can access from the earliest years of my life, the memory is fuzzy. It’s more a cluster of blurry snapshots unified by a jumble of vague feelings. There is box of crayons, a wooden sailboat floating across the page, and a teacher’s loaded question.</p>
<p>“Why is the ocean purple?”</p>
<p>In this moment, there’s confusion, embarrassment, and about as much self-doubt as this barely self-aware first grader is capable of.</p>
<p>It is the first of several clues that I, like 13 million people in the US and an estimated 300 million worldwide according to <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/a-cure-for-colorblindess/386450/">The Atlantic</a></em>, am colorblind. My condition gets confirmed not long after with the help of a school nurse and an Ishihara color vision test—basically a circle made up of many more tiny circles, all of which are very similar in color. They all have a number hidden among the dots, and folks like me have difficulty seeing some, or all, of those hidden numbers.</p>
<p>I’m one of the lucky ones. Aside from the aforementioned purple-sea debacle—and apart from once buying a pair of pink sunglasses that I truly believed to be gray and a purple shirt I was certain was blue—my condition hasn't impacted my life in any serious way.</p>
<p>I know that the bottom light in a traffic signal is the one that means go. And now, whenever I'm unsure about the color of a garment or accessory, I make sure to quiz the clerk at the checkout counter to make sure whatever I'm buying is the color I think it is.</p>
<p>For others, however, even a mild form of color vision deficiency can be life altering. In the most serious forms of this condition, it can be downright dangerous to perform certain tasks like work as an electrician or drive a car.</p>
<p>That's why Don McPherson, co-founder of the Berkeley-based <a href="http://enchroma.com/">EnChroma</a>, has spent the past five years of his life developing a technology to help colorblind individuals see the world the way he does—that is, in full color. Along with his business partner, Andrew Schmeder, McPherson claims to have created a lens that can correct for a number of types of color vision deficiencies—including the specific form I have. By blocking a discrete number of wavelengths, he says, the EnChroma lenses can help my eyes send a clearer, more precise signal to the color-processing centers of my brain.</p>
<p>It's a bold claim; scientists have known about the condition of colorblindness for the better part of two centuries. However, while some have worked to develop tools to aid the color vision deficient, no one has produced a product that can offer people like me much more than a crude workaround. Clearly, there was only one thing to do—I had to give the EnChroma shades a whirl. Would I come to see my surroundings in a brand new light—or color, as it were? Can a product like this really make the world a better place for those like me?</p>
<h2>The test</h2>
<p>EnChroma is not a new product, nor is it the only set of glasses aiming at colorblindness (see 2AI Labs, for instance). Founded in 2012, the company has been enjoying an increase in profile over the last year or so due to things like some viral marketing success and lower consumer pricing according to the <em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/business/enchromas-accidental-spectacles-find-niche-among-the-colorblind.html?_r=0">New York Times</a></em>. Today buying a pair of EnChroma glasses will be familiar to anyone who's jumped into the online frames world pioneered by companies like Warby Parker. While you <em>can </em>find them at some optometrist offices and retailers, EnChroma provides both an online storefront and an online evaluation for would-be customers to shop from home. The frames run the gamut from roughly $250 to $450, and they come in various styles that may most closely resemble sunglasses. While the company is still growing, EnChroma even offers a "<a href="http://enchroma.com/about-us/product-testing-program/">Product Testing Program</a>," where would-be wearers can apply to earn a free pair through participating in certain company initiatives (like talking to the media).</p>
<p>My journey begins after work one evening, sitting alone in my office and staring at my computer screen. I read the instructions on the EnChroma website before embarking on Ishihara's “hidden number” colorblindness test. I can still vaguely remember the school nurse holding up a series of cards just like these. The circles within circles resemble a collection of perfectly round Nerds candies.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the term “color blind” is colloquial and imprecise. To the uninitiated it can suggest a complete lack of color vision, but I don’t see in black and white. Some people do (though that iteration of the condition is extremely rare), while others also labeled with color blindness see mostly in shades of blue and yellow.</p>
<p>Simply put, there are many types that range in severity from mild to extreme. As such, scientists use the more precise term “color vision deficient” when speaking broadly about folks like me—folks born with dysfunctional color-sensing hardware.</p>
<p>In my case, a genetic glitch has caused the red and green sensing cones inside my eyes to overlap more than they do in the eyes of individuals with normal color vision. My condition is often referred to as a “red-green” color vision deficiency. It is the most common form of the color blindness and accounts for 99 percent of all cases.</p>

<p>People like me may have trouble distinguishing between certain shades between green and brown, red and brown, and yellow and orange. Pinks can appear gray, purple and blue get mixed up a lot, and the green light in a traffic signal may appear to be nothing more than bright white—the same color as the little man in the crosswalk sign.</p>
<p>So though I know that I will not pass this EnChroma test with flying colors, and though no one is around to witness any small victory I might claim, I am oddly competitive. In many cases, I’m ultimately unable to detect any semblance or gesture of a numeral hidden among the dots.</p>
<p>After clicking through about 30 slides, I learn that I am a "<a href="http://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/">moderate deutan</a>" (pronounced "doo-tan"). I like the name. It sounds as if I am the middle-of-the-road member of some intergalactic political party.</p>
<p>“Moderate deutans (‘doo-tans’) have a moderate form of red-green color blindness caused by an anomaly in the M-cone photopigment gene sequence,” the website says. I am informed that as a moderate deutan, I will likely respond very positively to the technology at work in the EnChroma lens.</p>
<p>I find myself smiling and nodding in agreement as I read the symptoms of my condition. Color-name confusion? Check. Green lights appearing white? You bet. Peanut butter looks green? Um… not so much. I must be a moderate deutan, indeed.</p>
<h2>The science</h2>
<p>I meet McPherson on a sunny day at a former mattress factory in an industrial area of South Berkeley. The building now serves as his laboratory. Inside, workbenches are covered in panels of glass of various colors, a faded chart of the visible spectrum and a large poster of the periodic table of elements hang on one wall. Sunlight streams into the space through opaque windows.</p>
<aside class="pullbox sidebar right"><h2>The day's delivery</h2>When I met McPherson, he was excited. He just received a new piece of equipment that he's been trying to get his hands on for some time—an anomaloscope, the most accurate tool available for determining the type and degree of an individual's color vision deficiency.
<p>The anomaloscope, he says, was invented at the beginning of the 20th century by a German ophthalmologist by the name Willibald Nagel. Colorblindness has been around much longer, however, and the first description of the condition was recorded by John Dalton in 1798. McPherson notes that's why it known as "Daltonism" for a time.</p>
<p>According to the EnChroma founder, James Clerk Maxwell designed the first pair of glasses to assist colorblind individuals in the mid-19th century. Far from correcting for any color vision deficiency, however, they were simply made up of three bands of glass—clear, green, and red. These simply allowed the wearer to better determine the actual color of articles he or she was unsure of.</p>
<p>Maxwell's glasses and other similar innovations—aimed more at gaming color blindness tests and helping the color vision deficient avoid Dalton-esque faux pas—have remained "the status quo up until the present," McPherson says. "There have been many people who've attempted to solve the problem and make eyewear, but it's never really addressed the underlying problem."</p></aside>
<p>This modern space is where EnChroma’s work pushes forward. When I visited, for instance, McPherson was excited about finally getting his hands on an anomaloscope, the most accurate tool available for determining the type and degree of an individual's color vision deficiency. But the road to advancing color correction took place well outside of a lab setting. In fact, McPherson says he stumbled upon the solution to providing the correct signal to color vision deficient eyes by accident.</p>
<p>Before founding EnChroma, McPherson worked for a company called Bay Glass Research—putting his Ph.D. in glass science to use by engineering better ways to protect the eyes of surgeons using high-powered lasers for precision medical procedures.</p>
<p>The first generation of protective eyewear these surgeons wore achieved its goal with thick, colored glass, which absorbed the powerful, eye-frying energy of the laser. However, those glasses gave the surgeons headaches and made it difficult for them to distinguish between the tan, pink, and red tones of human flesh. The physicians had little choice, they needed to rely on other visual cues during operation.</p>
<p>McPherson solved this problem by infusing glass panels with rare earth metals, which worked a bit like the surgeons he was aiding—by precisely targeting specific bands of the spectrum. These glasses effectively deflected the dangerous wavelengths of the laser, while letting all other light pass through.</p>
<p>The surgeons liked these glasses but not just in the operating room. McPherson soon got word that many of his clients were taking the shades home with them and using them as sunglasses. They liked the ultra-saturated world of color they produced. "They thought it was trippy and cool," he says.</p>
<p>The good scientist that he is, McPherson wanted to see what all the hubbub was about. And so, he made a pair for himself, inserting the customized glass panels into wrap-around Bollé frames, and unwittingly setting the stage for his a-ha moment.</p>
<p>In 2005, the self-described "avid ultimate Frisbee player" was wearing his high-tech shades at an ultimate tournament in Santa Cruz. While he was on the sidelines, resting, he lent the glasses to his friend and teammate.</p>
<p>"And he goes: 'Dude! These are so cool! I can see the cones!'"</p>
<p>McPherson's friend was referring to the orange, sideline-deliniating cones, which, as color blind man, he had previously been unable to see. McPherson knew this about his friend, and the news that his specialty glasses enabled him to see a color he had never seen before hit the EnChroma founder like a ton of bricks.</p>
<p>"I didn't play well after that," McPherson recalls. He was lost in thought—considering the nature of color vision deficiency and what exactly these particular glasses might be doing that to corrected for his friend's condition. After the match he began feverishly researching color blindness.</p>

<h2>“Waiting for the right signal”</h2>
<p>According to McPherson he could hardly have picked a better time to take up interest in the field. For starters, around 2009, scientists working on gene therapy research found evidence that the brains of color vision deficient individuals were able to process all of the colors in the visible spectrum, suggesting that if only the eyes could be aided in passing along the correct signal a previously color blind person might be able to see the way those with normal vision do.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cost of manufacturing the specialized EnChroma lenses—which would have been prohibitively expensive only a few years before McPherson started the company—had dropped significantly.</p>
<p score="8.5"><figure class="image right medium" score="12.5"><a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EnChroma.jpg" class="enlarge"><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EnChroma.jpg%202x" width="300"></a><figcaption class="caption" score="17.5"><div class="caption-text"><a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/EnChroma.jpg" class="enlarge">Enlarge</a> <span class="sep">/</span> EnChroma co-founders Dr. Don McPherson (left) and Andrew Schmeder (right)</div></figcaption></figure>Not only was McPherson empowered by the new scientific evidence on the nature of color blindness and the decrease in overhead production costs—he also had access to new tools for serious number crunching. These allowed his partner, Schmeder, to develop highly comprehensive models of the different kinds of color blindness and their causes.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the duo landed on what seems like a simple solution, but obviously has complex underpinnings. The EnChroma team figured out that by targeting and filtering out specific bands of the visible spectrum, they could help people with certain kinds of color vision deficiencies see more color.</p>
<p>According to McPherson, the issue facing those with color vision deficiencies isn't that they are entirely incapable of seeing color. Instead, it's that the very first step in the entire process gumming up the works.</p>
<p>He tells me the only thing wrong with me is that my cones, the tiny structures in the eye sensitive to pigmentation, are slightly misaligned. But while my hardware might be out of whack, he says, the science shows that my software is just fine.</p>
<p>"The neural mechanisms in your brain are perfectly OK," he says. "They're just waiting for the right signal. Because of that, if you can give the right signal, you can restore a person who is color deficient to the correct perception of color."</p>
<p>Most people have three types of pigment-sensitive cones in their eyes—blue, green and red. The information gathered by this trio, along with the information gathered by our light-sensitive rods, is processed by our brain and turned into a three-dimensional world of color.</p>
<p>In the eye of someone with normal color vision, these cones are arrayed in such a way that the blue cone stands on its own. McPherson says that this pigment sensitive cone was likely the very first to appear evolutionarily. The green- and red-sensitive cones are much more recent developments—at least on the evolutionary scale. The predominant theory is that the green cone was the second to emerge and that the red cone was an advantageous mutation, which came along not long afterward.</p>
<p>In individuals with a “deuteranomaly,” such as myself, the red-sensitive cones and the green-sensitive cones have "redshifted," or moved to overlap even more with the red cone, he explains.</p>
<p>Now, both the red and green cones are sensitive to different wavelengths of light, but they are also sensitive to the same wavelengths.</p>
<p>McPherson says the reason I sometimes mistake purple for blue is that I am not getting a “pure red signal” in my red channel. Because my red and green cones overlap more than is normal, there is distortion in my red signal processing. The same goes for my green channel.</p>
<p>By tailoring the EnChroma lenses to block the thin cluster of wavelengths detected by the excessively overlapping portion of my red- and green-sensitive cones, the shades create a greater separation of red and blue pigment perception—thus providing my brain with a cleaner duo of red and green channels, which, in turn, allows the color processing software in my brain to more accurately determine the true color of the object I am examining.</p>
<div class="centered-figure-container" score="17.5"><figure class="image center full full-width" score="12.5"><img src="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-28-at-2.09.14-PM.png" width="741"><figcaption class="caption" score="17.5"><div class="caption-text">Remember these blasts from your past?</div></figcaption></figure></div>
<h2>The noble goal</h2>
<p>All of this—the effect of overlapping cones on my ability to accurately detect green from brown, or red from purple—was, of course, unknown to me as I stare, perplexed and embarrassed, at the waxy surface of the paper I've unwittingly colored incorrectly.</p>
<p>Even it were understood by my teacher, Mrs. Mass, and she were to explain it all to me, it would go over my head. Because, at just 6 years old, I lack the ability to understand many things—including how to express my confusion and my shame and my self-doubt.</p>
<p>Luckily, I am not the sort of child who acts out in terrible fits when I feel this way. And luckily, the adults in my life, from instructors to parents to pediatricians, don't take this as a sign of some underlying learning disability and send me down a path of remedial lesson plans and vocational tracking.</p>
<p>According to McPherson, that's not just worst-case-scenario thinking. He cites a recent double-blind study, in which teachers were observed working in a classroom with children that were color vision deficient and others had normal color vision. The kids who mixed up their crayons, like I did, were treated differently.</p>
<p>"They were treated like they were a little slow," McPherson says. "It's not unusual for these color-deficient kids, because of their poor test scores, because they can't follow what's going on, that they get put into special ed programs. Does that make your blood boil? It makes my blood boil. We've got to fix that."</p>
<p>For this reason, and others—like the fact that childhood is when the brain is developing the vast bulk of its neural connections—McPherson says he believes the biggest utility for his technology is in pediatrics.</p>
<p>"Those are the people we most want to get the product to," he says. "Because that’s when you’re the most formative.</p>
<p>"You have to understand that 80 percent of information is visual in a classroom," he continues. "And a majority of that is color-coded. We’ve long-since left the time when people used white chalk on a black board. What they do is use color markers on whiteboards. And we hear this from people repeatedly: they can’t see the difference, or assignments are put out on brightly colored paper with different colored inks and they can’t read it."</p>
<p>As educators bring more computer- and tablet-based teaching tools into the classroom, these issues will not only persist, they could potentially get worse, unless something is done to address the problem.</p>
<p>Only 11 of 50 states currently test schoolchildren for color vision deficiency, according to McPherson. And just because a state mandates children be tested, doesn't mean that a given school or school district will have policies in place to help those who've been identified.</p>
<p>The dearth of public policy addressing colorblindness isn't helped by those in the vision community who have balked at McPherson's claims and his EnChroma products. Nor is it aided by those who have marketed products intended only to help people game the Ishihara test—colored lenses that coax out the hidden numbers, the same way the orange key hidden at the bottom of a box of sugary kids cereal reveals a secret message hidden on the back of the packaging.</p>
<p>Many are dismissive, McPherson says. However, he thinks most of "the haters" are focused on what they learned decades ago before recent advances in vision science—that color vision deficiencies can't be fixed—or else they believe that the EnChroma glasses are only effective in helping people cheat on color vision tests.<br>

<h2>The evaluation</h2>
<p><aside class="manual-ad right"></aside>Previous reviews of EnChroma glasses have been all over the map. <em><a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/15/enchroma-glasses-may-permanently-cure-color-blindness-328762.html">Newsweek</a> </em>enlisted a color-blind scientist who said the experience was like turning up the saturation in everyday life as he might in a photo editor. A colorblind <em><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/a-cure-for-colorblindess/386450/">Atlantic</a> </em>writer had a revelation with his New Balance sneakers even if the change wasn't as dramatic as he dreamed up. <a href="http://gizmodo.com/can-these-glasses-help-the-colorblind-we-put-en-chroma-1739433668">Gizmodo</a> talked with a color vision expert from the University of Washington who believes gene therapy remains the only true solution to color-blindness, though even he admitted that the lenses could improve perception. D15 test results—where participants "arrange 15 colored circles chromatically in the order of the rainbow"—shared with that site by EnChroma showed consistent improvement even if the level varied. Still, there's a reason the company maintains a 30-day return policy.</p>
<p>I can attest, first hand, that my pair of EnChroma glasses have no effect whatsoever on my perception of the Ishihara slides. That's not surprising, though. Language all over the EnChroma website is clear that the technology is not meant to help pass color vision tests.</p>
<p>I am somewhat surprised, however, when I first don them—precisely because of what doesn't happen. Unlike some of the testimonial videos on the EnChroma site, I do not find myself at a loss for words or overwhelmed with emotion.</p>
<p>I first put on my glasses in the San Jose Municipal Rose Garden. Established in 1931, the historic site is filled with roses of every color—white, pink, red and many shades in between. While I can immediately perceive a change, it is difficult to put my finger on exactly what is different. Later, a friend who tries the EnChroma shades on will tell me it's as if he is viewing the world through rose-colored glasses. But in the moment, in the Rose Garden, though things certainly appear more vibrant, I am suspicious that this may just be little more than an Instagram filter I can strap to my face.</p>
<p>But then I get into the car.</p>
<p>As I pull away from the garden, glasses still affixed to my head, I wonder whether the technology will be able to help me after all. My question is almost immediately answered, as I look up to see the greenest green traffic light I've ever seen.</p>
<p>"Whoah!" I exclaim, immediately understanding the power of these glasses. "That’s green! That’s really green!"</p>
<p>For the rest of my drive from San Jose to Santa Rosa the color green presents itself to me in new and exciting ways—mostly in the form of signs overhead and on the shoulder advising me of exits and the number of miles to the next town. They are a more brilliant shade of green than I am used to, with the exception of the weather-worn ones, which even with the glasses appear nearly the same as all of the signs always have.</p>
<p>It's been well over a month since I first peered through the EnChroma glasses. I find that I often look forward to stepping outside into the bright daylight, as I am still occasionally surprised by a color leaping out at me in a new and unexpected way. A pair of purple pants pops and a man's hair, died green at a local festival, takes on an electric luster, which only disappears when I remove my specs.</p>
<p>I can certainly live without the EnChroma glasses, of course. At 30, I've spent three full decades viewing the world in my own peculiar fashion, and I've been just fine. But then I think about 6-year-old me, staring in disbelief at the purple ocean, and believing it to be blue. And I think about all the confusion and trouble it could have caused had I not been identified as colorblind.</p>
<p>To think that a child's potential could be compromised simply because their red- and green-sensing cones have been shifted a few nanometers closer together is upsetting. I know life isn't fair, and that there are no guarantees in this cold and indifferent universe. But if we've got the ability to change someone's life for the better, and it's a simple as throwing on a pair of sunglasses, well, shouldn't we?</p>
