 <p>We've just released the new 0.10 version of Gobot, our open source robotics and Internet of Things (IoT) framework written in the Go programming language.
 This new version incorporates many changes and community contributions to make Gobot much faster, leaner. And of course, add lots more hardware support.</p>
 
 <p>We've got a list of the new changes below, but if you want to see the gory details, please check out the compare view on <a href="https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/compare/0.8.0...0.10">GitHub</a>.</p>
