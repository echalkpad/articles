<p>In an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/fcc-chairman-wheeler-net-neutrality/">op-ed published this morning</a>, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/tomwheelerfcc">Tom Wheeler</a>&#xA0;publicly&#xA0;announced that his agency will use Title II of the Communications Act to &#x201C;implement and enforce open internet protections.&#x201D;</p>
<p>Title II has long been the favored legal option of net neutrality allies.&#xA0;At the same time, using Title II as legal underpinning for open Internet rules is wildly unpopular among Internet service providers (ISPs). The Chairman&#x2019;s choice will lead to legal challenge.</p>
<p>The FCC is widely expected to unveil its formal plan today, or tomorrow. A vote will take place on February 26.</p>
<p>The broad outlines of the Chairman&#x2019;s plan, however, are already clear. In the op-ed, Wheeler notes that his rules will contain</p>
<blockquote><p>enforceable, bright-line rules will ban paid prioritization, and the blocking and throttling of lawful content and services. I propose to fully apply&#x2014;for the first time ever&#x2014;those bright-line rules to mobile broadband.</p></blockquote>
<p>The inclusion of wireless Internet services alongside wireline will kick up additional dust.</p>
<p>Wheeler also noted in his missive that he will cast off certain parts of Title II that he doesn&#x2019;t feel are suited to regulating Internet access. More detail will certainly follow, but at a minimum, the Chairman notes that &#x201C;there will be no rate regulation, no tariffs, [and] no last-mile unbundling&#x201D; in the regulations.</p>
<p>Most interesting, however, in the Chairman&#x2019;s comments, however, is his explanation of how his mind changed regarding what legal foundation net neutrality would be best supported by &#x2014; the Chairman&#x2019;s initial concept of using Section 706 of the&#xA0;Telecommunications Act of 1996, which caused some heartburn among open Internet advocates who worried that the FCC would lose in court, again, if it followed that path.</p>
<p>Here&#x2019;s Wheeler:</p>
<blockquote><p>Originally, I believed that the FCC could assure internet openness through a determination of &#x201C;commercial reasonableness&#x201D; under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. While a recent court decision seemed to draw a roadmap for using this approach, I became concerned that this relatively new concept might, down the road, be interpreted to mean what is reasonable for commercial interests, not consumers.</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, because the guiding rules would favor corporations, and not consumers, the Chairman decided that structure would not suffice.</p>
<p>In short, strict net neutrality regulations are coming, including wireless connections. If the rules will deal with interconnection agreements is not immediately clear. It&#x2019;s game time, and Wheeler appears to be girded for war.</p>
