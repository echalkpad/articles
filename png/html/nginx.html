<div><p>nginx (pronounced "engine x") is a free open source web server
written by Igor Sysoev, a Russian software engineer. Since its public
launch in 2004, nginx has focused on high performance, high
concurrency and low memory usage. Additional features on top of the
web server functionality, like load balancing, caching, access and
bandwidth control, and the ability to integrate efficiently with a
variety of applications, have helped to make nginx a good choice for
modern website architectures. Currently nginx is the second most
popular open source web server on the Internet.</p>

<section>
<h2>14.1. Why Is High Concurrency Important?</h2>

<p>These days the Internet is so widespread and ubiquitous it's hard to
imagine it wasn't exactly there, as we know it, a decade ago. It has greatly evolved,
from simple HTML producing clickable text, based on NCSA and then on
Apache web servers, to an always-on communication medium used by more
than 2 billion users worldwide. With the proliferation of permanently
connected PCs, mobile devices and recently tablets, the Internet
landscape is rapidly changing and entire economies have become
digitally wired. Online services have become much more elaborate with
a clear bias towards instantly available live information and
entertainment. Security aspects of running online business have also
significantly changed. Accordingly, websites are now much more complex
than before, and generally require a lot more engineering efforts to
be robust and scalable.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges for a website architect has always been
concurrency. Since the beginning of web services, the level of
concurrency has been continuously growing. It's not uncommon for a
popular website to serve hundreds of thousands and even millions of
simultaneous users. A decade ago, the major cause of concurrency was
slow clients&#x2014;users with ADSL or dial-up connections. Nowadays,
concurrency is caused by a combination of mobile clients and newer
application architectures which are typically based on maintaining a
persistent connection that allows the client to be updated with news,
tweets, friend feeds, and so on. Another important factor contributing
to increased concurrency is the changed behavior of modern browsers,
which open four to six simultaneous connections to a website to
improve page load speed.</p>

<p>To illustrate the problem with slow clients, imagine a simple
Apache-based web server which produces a relatively short 100 KB
response&#x2014;a web page with text or an image. It can be merely a
fraction of a second to generate or retrieve this page, but it takes
10 seconds to transmit it to a client with a bandwidth of 80 kbps (10
KB/s). Essentially, the web server would relatively quickly pull 100
KB of content, and then it would be busy for 10 seconds slowly sending
this content to the client before freeing its connection. Now imagine
that you have 1,000 simultaneously connected clients who have
requested similar content. If only 1 MB of additional memory is
allocated per client, it would result in 1000 MB (about 1 GB) of
extra memory devoted to serving just 1000 clients 100 KB of
content. In reality, a typical web server based on Apache commonly
allocates more than 1 MB of additional memory per connection, and
regrettably tens of kbps is still often the effective speed of mobile
communications. Although the situation with sending content to a slow
client might be, to some extent, improved by increasing the size of
operating system kernel socket buffers, it's not a general solution to
the problem and can have undesirable side effects.</p>

<p>With persistent connections the problem of handling concurrency is
even more pronounced, because to avoid latency associated with
establishing new HTTP connections, clients would stay connected, and
for each connected client there's a certain amount of memory allocated
by the web server.</p>

<p>Consequently, to handle the increased workloads associated with
growing audiences and hence higher levels of concurrency&#x2014;and to be
able to continuously do so&#x2014;a website should be based on a number of
very efficient building blocks. While the other parts of the equation
such as hardware (CPU, memory, disks), network capacity, application
and data storage architectures are obviously important, it is in the
web server software that client connections are accepted and
processed. Thus, the web server should be able to scale nonlinearly
with the growing number of simultaneous connections and requests per
second.</p>

<section>
<h3>Isn't Apache Suitable?</h3>

<p>Apache, the web server software that still largely dominates the
Internet today, has its roots in the beginning of the
1990s. Originally, its architecture matched the then-existing
operating systems and hardware, but also the state of the 
Internet, where a website was typically a standalone physical server
running a single instance of Apache. By the beginning of the 2000s it
was obvious that the standalone web server model could not be easily
replicated to satisfy the needs of growing web services. Although
Apache provided a solid foundation for future development, it was
architected to spawn a copy of itself for each new connection, which
was not suitable for nonlinear scalability of a website. Eventually
Apache became a general purpose web server focusing on having many
different features, a variety of third-party extensions, and universal
applicability to practically any kind of web application
development. However, nothing comes without a price and the downside
to having such a rich and universal combination of tools in a single
piece of software is less scalability because of increased CPU and
memory usage per connection.</p>

<p>Thus, when server hardware, operating systems and network resources
ceased to be major constraints for website growth, web developers
worldwide started to look around for a more efficient means of running
web servers. Around ten years ago, Daniel Kegel, a prominent software
engineer, <a href="http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html">proclaimed</a> that "it's time for web servers to handle ten
thousand clients simultaneously" and predicted what we
now call Internet cloud services. Kegel's C10K manifest spurred a
number of attempts to solve the problem of web server optimization to
handle a large number of clients at the same time, and nginx turned
out to be one of the most successful ones.</p>

<p>Aimed at solving the C10K problem of 10,000 simultaneous connections,
nginx was written with a different architecture in mind&#x2014;one which is
much more suitable for nonlinear scalability in both the number of
simultaneous connections and requests per second. nginx is
event-based, so it does not follow Apache's style of spawning new
processes or threads for each web page request. The end result is that
even as load increases, memory and CPU usage remain manageable. nginx
can now deliver tens of thousands of concurrent connections on a
server with typical hardware.</p>

<p>When the first version of nginx was released, it was meant to be
deployed alongside Apache such that static content like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and images were handled by nginx to offload concurrency and
latency processing from Apache-based application servers. Over the
course of its development, nginx has added integration with
applications through the use of FastCGI, uswgi or SCGI protocols, and
with distributed memory object caching systems like
<em>memcached</em>. Other useful functionality like reverse proxy with
load balancing and caching was added as well. These additional
features have shaped nginx into an efficient combination of tools
to build a scalable web infrastructure upon.</p>

<p>In February 2012, the Apache 2.4.x branch was released to the public. Although
this latest release of Apache has added new multi-processing core modules and
new proxy modules aimed at enhancing scalability and performance, it's too soon
to tell if its performance, concurrency and resource utilization are now on par
with, or better than, pure event-driven web servers. It would be very nice to
see Apache application servers scale better with the new version, though, as it
could potentially alleviate bottlenecks on the backend side which still often
remain unsolved in typical nginx-plus-Apache web configurations.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Are There More Advantages to Using nginx?</h3>

<p>Handling high concurrency with high performance and efficiency has
always been the key benefit of deploying nginx. However, there
are now even more interesting benefits.</p>

<p>In the last few years, web architects have embraced the idea of
decoupling and separating their application infrastructure from the
web server. However, what would previously exist in the form of a LAMP
(Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, Python or Perl)-based website, might now
become not merely a LEMP-based one (`E' standing for `Engine
x'), but more and more often an exercise in pushing the web server to
the edge of the infrastructure and integrating the same or a revamped
set of applications and database tools around it in a different way.</p>

<p>nginx is very well suited for this, as it provides the key features
necessary to conveniently offload concurrency, latency processing, SSL
(secure sockets layer), static content, compression and caching,
connections and requests throttling, and even HTTP media streaming
from the application layer to a much more efficient edge web server
layer. It also allows integrating directly with memcached/Redis or
other "NoSQL" solutions, to boost performance when serving a large
number of concurrent users.</p>

<p>With recent flavors of development kits and programming languages
gaining wide use, more and more companies are changing their
application development and deployment habits. nginx has become one of
the most important components of these changing paradigms, and it
has already helped many companies start and develop their web services
quickly and within their budgets.</p>

<p>The first lines of nginx were written in 2002. In 2004 it was released
to the public under the two-clause BSD license. The number of nginx
users has been growing ever since, contributing ideas, and submitting
bug reports, suggestions and observations that have been immensely
helpful and beneficial for the entire community.</p>

<p>The nginx codebase is original and was written entirely from scratch
in the C programming language. nginx has been ported to many
architectures and operating systems, including Linux, FreeBSD,
Solaris, Mac OS X, AIX and Microsoft Windows. nginx has its own
libraries and with its standard modules does not use much beyond the
system's C library, except for zlib, PCRE and OpenSSL which can be
optionally excluded from a build if not needed or because of potential
license conflicts.</p>

<p>A few words about the Windows version of nginx. While nginx works in a
Windows environment, the Windows version of nginx is more like a
proof-of-concept rather than a fully functional port. There are
certain limitations of the nginx and Windows kernel architectures that
do not interact well at this time. The known issues of the nginx
version for Windows include a much lower number of concurrent
connections, decreased performance, no caching and no bandwidth
policing. Future versions of nginx for Windows will match the
mainstream functionality more closely.</p>

<h2>14.2. Overview of nginx Architecture</h2>

<p>Traditional process- or thread-based models of handling concurrent
connections involve handling each connection with a separate process
or thread, and blocking on network or input/output
operations. Depending on the application, it can be very inefficient
in terms of memory and CPU consumption. Spawning a separate process or
thread requires preparation of a new runtime environment, including
allocation of heap and stack memory, and the creation of a new
execution context. Additional CPU time is also spent creating these
items, which can eventually lead to poor performance due to thread
thrashing on excessive context switching. All of these complications
manifest themselves in older web server architectures like
Apache's. This is a tradeoff between offering a rich set of generally
applicable features and optimized usage of server resources.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, nginx was meant to be a specialized tool to
achieve more performance, density and economical use of server
resources while enabling dynamic growth of a website, so it has
followed a different model. It was actually inspired by the ongoing
development of advanced event-based mechanisms in a variety of
operating systems. What resulted is a modular, event-driven,
asynchronous, single-threaded, non-blocking architecture which became
the foundation of nginx code.</p>

<p>nginx uses multiplexing and event notifications heavily, and dedicates
specific tasks to separate processes. Connections are processed in a
highly efficient run-loop in a limited number of single-threaded
processes called <code>worker</code>s. Within each <code>worker</code> nginx can
handle many thousands of concurrent connections and requests per
second.</p>

<section>
<h3>Code Structure</h3>

<p>The nginx <code>worker</code> code includes the core and the functional
modules. The core of nginx is responsible for maintaining a tight
run-loop and executing appropriate sections of modules' code on each
stage of request processing. Modules constitute most of the
presentation and application layer functionality. Modules read from
and write to the network and storage, transform content, do outbound
filtering, apply server-side include actions and pass the requests to
the upstream servers when proxying is activated.</p>

<p>nginx's modular architecture generally allows developers to extend the
set of web server features without modifying the nginx core. nginx
modules come in slightly different incarnations, namely core modules,
event modules, phase handlers, protocols, variable handlers, filters,
upstreams and load balancers. At this time, nginx doesn't support
dynamically loaded modules; i.e., modules are compiled along with the
core at build stage. However, support for loadable modules and ABI is
planned for the future major releases. More detailed information about
the roles of different modules can be found in 
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html#sec.nginx.internals">Section 14.4</a>.</p>

<p>While handling a variety of actions associated with accepting,
processing and managing network connections and content retrieval,
nginx uses event notification mechanisms and a number of disk I/O
performance enhancements in Linux, Solaris and BSD-based operating
systems, like <code>kqueue</code>, <code>epoll</code>, and <code>event ports</code>. The
goal is to provide as many hints to the operating system as possible,
in regards to obtaining timely asynchronous feedback for inbound and
outbound traffic, disk operations, reading from or writing to sockets,
timeouts and so on. The usage of different methods for multiplexing
and advanced I/O operations is heavily optimized for every Unix-based
operating system nginx runs on.</p>

<p>A high-level overview of nginx architecture is presented in
<a href="http://www.aosabook.org/en/nginx.html#fig.nginx.arch">Figure 14.1</a>.</p>

<section>
<h3>Workers Model</h3>

<p>As previously mentioned, nginx doesn't spawn a process or thread for
every connection. Instead, <code>worker</code> processes accept new requests
from a shared "listen" socket and execute a highly efficient
run-loop inside each <code>worker</code> to process thousands of connections
per <code>worker</code>. There's no specialized arbitration or distribution of
connections to the <code>worker</code>s in nginx; this work is done by the OS 
kernel mechanisms. Upon startup, an initial set of
listening sockets is created. <code>worker</code>s then continuously accept,
read from and write to the sockets while processing HTTP requests and
responses.</p>

<p>The run-loop is the most complicated part of the nginx <code>worker</code>
code. It includes comprehensive inner calls and relies heavily on the
idea of asynchronous task handling. Asynchronous operations are
implemented through modularity, event notifications, extensive use of
callback functions and fine-tuned timers. Overall, the key principle
is to be as non-blocking as possible. The only situation where nginx
can still block is when there's not enough disk storage performance
for a <code>worker</code> process.</p>

<p>Because nginx does not fork a process or thread per connection, memory
usage is very conservative and extremely efficient in the vast
majority of cases. nginx conserves CPU cycles as well because there's
no ongoing create-destroy pattern for processes or threads. What nginx
does is check the state of the network and storage, initialize new
connections, add them to the run-loop, and process asynchronously
until completion, at which point the connection is deallocated and
removed from the run-loop. Combined with the careful use of
<code>syscall</code>s and an accurate implementation of supporting
interfaces like pool and slab memory allocators, nginx typically
achieves moderate-to-low CPU usage even under extreme workloads.</p>

<p>Because nginx spawns several <code>worker</code>s to handle connections, it
scales well across multiple cores. Generally, a separate <code>worker</code>
per core allows full utilization of multicore architectures, and
prevents thread thrashing and lock-ups. There's no resource starvation
and the resource controlling mechanisms are isolated within
single-threaded <code>worker</code> processes. This model also allows more
scalability across physical storage devices, facilitates more disk
utilization and avoids blocking on disk I/O. As a result, server
resources are utilized more efficiently with the workload shared
across several workers.</p>

<p>With some disk use and CPU load patterns, the number of nginx
<code>worker</code>s should be adjusted. The rules are somewhat basic here,
and system administrators should try a couple of configurations for
their workloads. General recommendations might be the following: if
the load pattern is CPU intensive&#x2014;for instance, handling a lot of
TCP/IP, doing SSL, or compression&#x2014;the number of nginx <code>worker</code>s
should match the number of CPU cores; if the load is mostly disk I/O
bound&#x2014;for instance, serving different sets of content from storage,
or heavy proxying&#x2014;the number of <code>worker</code>s might be one and a half
to two times the number of cores. Some engineers choose the number of
<code>worker</code>s based on the number of individual storage units
instead, though efficiency of this approach depends on the type and
configuration of disk storage.</p>

<p>One major problem that the developers of nginx will be solving in upcoming
versions is how to avoid most of the blocking on disk I/O. At the moment, if
there's not enough storage performance to serve disk operations generated by a
particular <code>worker</code>, that <code>worker</code> may still block on reading/writing
from disk. A number of mechanisms and configuration file directives exist to
mitigate such disk I/O blocking scenarios. Most notably, combinations of
options like sendfile and AIO typically produce a lot of headroom for disk
performance. An nginx installation should be planned based on the data set,
the amount of memory available for nginx, and the underlying storage architecture.</p>

<p>Another problem with the existing <code>worker</code> model is related to
limited support for embedded scripting. For one, with the standard
nginx distribution, only embedding Perl scripts is supported. There is
a simple explanation for that: the key problem is the
possibility of an embedded script to block on any
operation or exit unexpectedly. Both types of behavior would
immediately lead to a situation where the worker is hung, affecting
many thousands of connections at once. More work is planned to make
embedded scripting with nginx simpler, more reliable and suitable for
a broader range of applications.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>nginx Process Roles</h3>

<p>nginx runs several processes in memory; there is a single master
process and several <code>worker</code> processes. There are also a couple
of special purpose processes, specifically a cache loader and cache
manager. All processes are single-threaded in version 1.x of
nginx. All processes primarily use shared-memory mechanisms for
inter-process communication. The master process is run as the
<code>root</code> user. The cache loader, cache manager and <code>worker</code>s
run as an unprivileged user.</p>

<p>The master process is responsible for the following tasks:</p>

<ul>

<li>
 reading and validating configuration
</li>

<li>
 creating, binding and closing sockets
</li>

<li>
 starting, terminating and maintaining the configured number of
 <code>worker</code> processes
</li>

<li>
 reconfiguring without service interruption
</li>

<li>
 controlling non-stop binary upgrades (starting new binary and
rolling back if necessary)
</li>

<li>
 re-opening log files
</li>

<li>
 compiling embedded Perl scripts
</li>

</ul>

<p>The <code>worker</code> processes accept, handle and process connections
from clients, provide reverse proxying and filtering functionality and
do almost everything else that nginx is capable of. In regards to
monitoring the behavior of an nginx instance, a system administrator
should keep an eye on <code>worker</code>s as they are the processes
reflecting the actual day-to-day operations of a web server.</p>

<p>The cache loader process is responsible for checking the on-disk cache
items and populating nginx's in-memory database with cache
metadata. Essentially, the cache loader prepares nginx instances to
work with files already stored on disk in a specially allocated
directory structure. It traverses the directories, checks cache
content metadata, updates the relevant entries in shared memory and
then exits when everything is clean and ready for use.</p>

<p>The cache manager is mostly responsible for cache expiration and
invalidation. It stays in memory during normal nginx operation and it
is restarted by the master process in the case of failure.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h3>Brief Overview of nginx Caching</h3>

<p>Caching in nginx is implemented in the form of hierarchical data
storage on a filesystem. Cache keys are configurable, and different
request-specific parameters can be used to control what gets into the
cache. Cache keys and cache metadata are stored in the shared memory
segments, which the cache loader, cache manager and <code>worker</code>s
can access. Currently there is not any in-memory caching of files,
other than optimizations implied by the operating system's virtual
filesystem mechanisms. Each cached response is placed in a different
file on the filesystem. The hierarchy (levels and naming details) are
controlled through nginx configuration directives. When a response is
written to the cache directory structure, the path and the name of the
file are derived from an MD5 hash of the proxy URL.</p>

<p>The process for placing content in the cache is as follows:
When nginx reads the response from an upstream server, the
content is first written to a temporary file outside of the cache
directory structure. When nginx finishes processing the request it
renames the temporary file and moves it to the cache directory. If the
temporary files directory for proxying is on another file system, the
file will be copied, thus it's recommended to keep both temporary and
cache directories on the same file system. It is also quite safe to
delete files from the cache directory structure when they need to be
explicitly purged. There are third-party extensions for nginx
which make it possible to control cached content remotely,
and more work is planned to integrate this functionality in the main
distribution.</p>

</section>

<section>
<h2>14.3. nginx Configuration</h2>

<p>nginx's configuration system was inspired by Igor Sysoev's experiences with
Apache. His main insight was 
that a scalable configuration system
is essential for a web server. The main scaling problem was
encountered when maintaining large complicated configurations with
lots of virtual servers, directories, locations and datasets. In a
relatively big web setup it can be a nightmare if not done properly
both at the application level and by the system engineer himself.</p>

<p>As a result, nginx configuration was designed to simplify day-to-day
operations and to provide an easy means for further expansion of web
server configuration.</p>

<p>nginx configuration is kept in a number of plain text files which
typically reside in <code>/usr/local/etc/nginx</code> or
<code>/etc/nginx</code>. The main configuration file is usually called
<code>nginx.conf</code>. To keep it uncluttered, parts of the configuration
can be put in separate files which can be automatically included in
the main one. However, it should be noted here that nginx does not
currently support Apache-style distributed configurations (i.e.,
<code>.htaccess</code> files). All of the configuration relevant to nginx
web server behavior should reside in a centralized set of
configuration files.</p>

<p>The configuration files are initially read and verified by the master
process. A compiled read-only form of the nginx configuration is
available to the <code>worker</code> processes as they are forked from the
master process. Configuration structures are automatically shared by
the usual virtual memory management mechanisms.</p>

<p>nginx configuration has several different contexts for <code>main</code>,
<code>http</code>, <code>server</code>, <code>upstream</code>, <code>location</code> (and also
<code>mail</code> for mail proxy) blocks of directives. Contexts never
overlap. For instance, there is no such thing as putting a
<code>location</code> block in the <code>main</code> block of directives. Also, to
avoid unnecessary ambiguity there isn't anything like a "global web
server" configuration. nginx configuration is meant to be clean and
logical, allowing users to maintain complicated configuration files
that comprise thousands of directives. In a private conversation, 
Sysoev said, 
"Locations, directories, and other blocks in the global server
configuration are the features I never liked in Apache, so this is the
reason why they were never implemented in nginx."</p>

<p>Configuration syntax, formatting and definitions follow a so-called
C-style convention. This particular approach to making configuration
files is already being used by a variety of open source and
commercial software applications. By design, C-style configuration is well-suited 
for nested descriptions, being logical and easy to create, read
and maintain, and liked by many engineers. C-style configuration of
nginx can also be easily automated.</p>

<p>While some of the nginx directives resemble certain parts of Apache
configuration, setting up an nginx instance is quite a different
experience. For instance, rewrite rules are supported by nginx, though
it would require an administrator to manually adapt a legacy Apache
rewrite configuration to match nginx style. The implementation of the
rewrite engine differs too.</p>

<p>In general, nginx settings also provide support for several original
mechanisms that can be very useful as part of a lean web server
configuration. It makes sense to briefly mention variables and the
<code>try_files</code> directive, which are somewhat unique to
nginx. Variables in nginx were developed to provide an additional 
even-more-powerful mechanism to control run-time configuration of a web
server. Variables are optimized for quick evaluation and are
internally pre-compiled to indices. Evaluation is done on demand;
i.e., the value of a variable is typically calculated only once and
cached for the lifetime of a particular request. Variables can be used
with different configuration directives, providing additional
flexibility for describing conditional request processing
behavior. </p>

<p>The <code>try_files</code> directive was initially meant to
gradually replace conditional <code>if</code> configuration statements in a
more proper way, and it was designed to quickly and efficiently
try/match against different URI-to-content mappings. Overall, the
<code>try_files</code> directive works well and can be extremely efficient
and useful. It is recommended that the reader thoroughly check the
<a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#try_files"><code>try_files</code> directive</a> and adopt its use whenever applicable.</p>

</section>

<section id="sec.nginx.internals">
<h2>14.4. nginx Internals</h2>

<p>As was mentioned before, the nginx codebase consists of a core and a
number of modules. The core of nginx is responsible for providing the
foundation of the web server, web and mail reverse proxy
functionalities; it enables the use of underlying network protocols,
builds the necessary run-time environment, and ensures seamless
interaction between different modules. However, most of the protocol-
and application-specific features are done by nginx modules, not the
core.</p>

<p>Internally, nginx processes connections through a pipeline, or chain,
of modules. In other words, for every operation there's a module which
is doing the relevant work; e.g., compression, modifying content,
executing server-side includes, communicating to the upstream
application servers through FastCGI or uwsgi protocols, or talking to
memcached.</p>

<p>There are a couple of nginx modules that sit somewhere between the
core and the real "functional" modules. These modules are
<code>http</code> and <code>mail</code>. These two modules provide an
additional level of abstraction between the core and lower-level
components. In these modules, the handling of the sequence of events
associated with a respective application layer protocol like HTTP,
SMTP or IMAP is implemented. In combination with the nginx core, these
upper-level modules are responsible for maintaining the right order of
calls to the respective functional modules. While the HTTP protocol is
currently implemented as part of the <code>http</code> module, there
are plans to separate it into a functional module in the future, due
to the need to support other protocols like SPDY (see "<a href="http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY: An
experimental protocol for a faster web</a>").</p>

<p>The functional modules can be divided into event modules, phase
handlers, output filters, variable handlers, protocols, upstreams and
load balancers. Most of these modules complement the HTTP
functionality of nginx, though event modules and protocols are also
used for <code>mail</code>. Event modules provide a particular OS-dependent
event notification mechanism like <code>kqueue</code> or <code>epoll</code>. The
event module that nginx uses depends on the operating system
capabilities and build configuration. Protocol modules allow nginx to
communicate through HTTPS, TLS/SSL, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP.</p>

<p>A typical HTTP request processing cycle looks like the following.</p>

<ol>

<li>
 Client sends HTTP request.
</li>

<li>
 nginx core chooses the appropriate phase handler based on the
 configured location matching the request.
</li>

<li>
 If configured to do so, a load balancer picks an upstream server
 for proxying.
</li>

<li>
 Phase handler does its job and passes each output buffer to the first
 filter.
</li>

<li>
 First filter passes the output to the second filter.
</li>

<li>
 Second filter passes the output to third (and so on).
</li>

<li>
 Final response is sent to the client.
</li>

</ol>

<p>nginx module invocation is extremely customizable. It is performed
through a series of callbacks using pointers to the executable
functions. However, the downside of this is that it may place a big
burden on programmers who would like to write their own modules,
because they must define exactly how and when the module should
run. Both the nginx API and developers' documentation are being
improved and made more available to alleviate this.</p>

<p>Some examples of where a module can attach are:</p>

<ul>

<li>
 Before the configuration file is read and processed
</li>

<li>
 For each configuration directive for the location and the server
 where it appears
</li>

<li>
 When the main configuration is initialized
</li>

<li>
 When the server (i.e., host/port) is initialized
</li>

<li>
 When the server configuration is merged with the main
 configuration
</li>

<li>
 When the location configuration is initialized or merged with
 its parent server configuration
</li>

<li>
 When the master process starts or exits
</li>

<li>
 When a new worker process starts or exits
</li>

<li>
 When handling a request
</li>

<li>
 When filtering the response header and the body
</li>

<li>
 When picking, initiating and re-initiating a request to an
 upstream server
</li>

<li>
 When processing the response from an upstream server
</li>

<li>
 When finishing an interaction with an upstream server
</li>

</ul>

<p>Inside a <code>worker</code>, the sequence of actions leading to the
run-loop where the response is generated looks like the following:</p>

<ol>

<li>
 Begin <code>ngx_worker_process_cycle()</code>.
</li>

<li>
 Process events with OS specific mechanisms (such as <code>epoll</code>
 or <code>kqueue</code>).
</li>

<li>
 Accept events and dispatch the relevant actions.
</li>

<li>
 Process/proxy request header and body.
</li>

<li>
 Generate response content (header, body) and stream it to the
 client.
</li>

<li>
 Finalize request.
</li>

<li>
 Re-initialize timers and events.
</li>

</ol>

<p>The run-loop itself (steps 5 and 6) ensures incremental generation of
a response and streaming it to the client.</p>

<p>A more detailed view of processing an HTTP request might look like
this:</p>

<ol>

<li>
 Initialize request processing.
</li>

<li>
 Process header.
</li>

<li>
 Process body.
</li>

<li>
 Call the associated handler.
</li>

<li>
 Run through the processing phases.
</li>

</ol>

<p>Which brings us to the phases. When nginx handles an HTTP request, it
passes it through a number of processing phases. At each phase there
are handlers to call. In general, phase handlers process a request and
produce the relevant output. Phase handlers are attached to the
locations defined in the configuration file.</p>

<p>Phase handlers typically do four things: get the location
configuration, generate an appropriate response, send the header, and
send the body. A handler has one argument: a specific structure
describing the request. A request structure has a lot of useful
information about the client request, such as the request method, URI,
and header.</p>

<p>When the HTTP request header is read, nginx does a lookup of the
associated virtual server configuration. If the virtual server is
found, the request goes through six phases:</p>

<ol>

<li>
 server rewrite phase
</li>

<li>
 location phase
</li>

<li>
 location rewrite phase (which can bring the request back to the
previous phase)
</li>

<li>
 access control phase
</li>

<li>
 try_files phase
</li>

<li>
 log phase
</li>

</ol>

<p>In an attempt to generate the necessary content in response to the
request, nginx passes the request to a suitable content
handler. Depending on the exact location configuration, nginx may try
so-called unconditional handlers first, like <code>perl</code>,
<code>proxy_pass</code>, <code>flv</code>, <code>mp4</code>, etc. If the request does
not match any of the above content handlers, it is picked by one of
the following handlers, in this exact order: <code>random index</code>,
<code>index</code>, <code>autoindex</code>, <code>gzip_static</code>, <code>static</code>.</p>

<p>Indexing module details can be found in the nginx documentation, but
these are the modules which handle requests with a trailing slash. If
a specialized module like <code>mp4</code> or <code>autoindex</code> isn't
appropriate, the content is considered to be just a file or directory
on disk (that is, static) and is served by the <code>static</code> content
handler. For a directory it would automatically rewrite the URI so
that the trailing slash is always there (and then issue an HTTP
redirect).</p>

<p>The content handlers' content is then passed to the filters. Filters
are also attached to locations, and there can be several filters
configured for a location. Filters do the task of manipulating the
output produced by a handler. The order of filter execution is
determined at compile time. For the out-of-the-box filters it's
predefined, and for a third-party filter it can be configured at the
build stage. In the existing nginx implementation, filters can only do
outbound changes and there is currently no mechanism to write and
attach filters to do input content transformation. Input filtering
will appear in future versions of nginx.</p>

<p>Filters follow a particular design pattern. A filter gets called,
starts working, and calls the next filter until the final filter in
the chain is called. After that, nginx finalizes the response. Filters
don't have to wait for the previous filter to finish. The next filter
in a chain can start its own work as soon as the input from the
previous one is available (functionally much like the Unix
pipeline). In turn, the output response being generated can be passed
to the client before the entire response from the upstream server is
received.</p>

<p>There are header filters and body filters; nginx feeds the header and
the body of the response to the associated filters separately.</p>

<p>A header filter consists of three basic steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>
 Decide whether to operate on this response.
</li>

<li>
 Operate on the response.
</li>

<li>
 Call the next filter.
</li>

</ol>

<p>Body filters transform the generated content. Examples of body filters
include:</p>

<ul>

<li>
 server-side includes
</li>

<li>
 XSLT filtering
</li>

<li>
 image filtering (for instance, resizing images on the fly)
</li>

<li>
 charset modification
</li>

<li>
 <code>gzip</code> compression
</li>

<li>
 chunked encoding
</li>

</ul>

<p>After the filter chain, the response is passed to the writer. Along
with the writer there are a couple of additional special purpose
filters, namely the <code>copy</code> filter, and the <code>postpone</code>
filter. The <code>copy</code> filter is responsible for filling memory
buffers with the relevant response content which might be stored in a
proxy temporary directory. The <code>postpone</code> filter is used for
subrequests.</p>

<p>Subrequests are a very important mechanism for request/response
processing. Subrequests are also one of the most powerful aspects of
nginx. With subrequests nginx can return the results from a different
URL than the one the client originally requested. Some web frameworks
call this an internal redirect. However, nginx goes further&#x2014;not only
can filters perform multiple subrequests and combine the outputs into
a single response, but subrequests can also be nested and
hierarchical. A subrequest can perform its own sub-subrequest, and a
sub-subrequest can initiate sub-sub-subrequests. Subrequests can map
to files on the hard disk, other handlers, or upstream
servers. Subrequests are most useful for inserting additional content
based on data from the original response. For example, the SSI
(server-side include) module uses a filter to parse the contents of
the returned document, and then replaces <code>include</code> directives
with the contents of specified URLs. Or, it can be an example of making
a filter that treats the entire contents of a document as a URL to be
retrieved, and then appends the new document to the URL itself.</p>

<p>Upstream and load balancers are also worth describing
briefly. Upstreams are used to implement what can be identified as a
content handler which is a reverse proxy (<code>proxy_pass</code>
handler).
Upstream modules mostly prepare the request to be sent to an upstream
server (or "backend") and receive the response from the upstream
server. There are no calls to output filters here. What an upstream
module does exactly is set callbacks to be invoked when the upstream
server is ready to be written to and read from. Callbacks implementing
the following functionality exist:</p>

<ul>

<li>
 Crafting a request buffer (or a chain of them) to be sent to the
 upstream server
</li>

<li>
 Re-initializing/resetting the connection to the upstream server
 (which happens right before creating the request again)
</li>

<li>
 Processing the first bits of an upstream response and saving
 pointers to the payload received from the upstream server
</li>

<li>
 Aborting requests (which happens when the client terminates
 prematurely)
</li>

<li>
 Finalizing the request when nginx finishes reading from the
 upstream server
</li>

<li>
 Trimming the response body (e.g. removing a trailer)
</li>

</ul>

<p>Load balancer modules attach to the <code>proxy_pass</code> handler to
provide the ability to choose an upstream server when more than one
upstream server is eligible. A load balancer registers an enabling
configuration file directive, provides additional upstream
initialization functions (to resolve upstream names in DNS, etc.),
initializes the connection structures, decides where to route the
requests, and updates stats
information. Currently nginx supports two standard disciplines for
load balancing to upstream servers: round-robin and ip-hash.</p>

<p>Upstream and load balancing handling mechanisms include algorithms to
detect failed upstream servers and to re-route new requests to the
remaining ones&#x2014;though a lot of additional work is planned to enhance
this functionality. In general, more work on load balancers is
planned, and in the next versions of nginx the mechanisms for
distributing the load across different upstream servers as well as
health checks will be greatly improved.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of other interesting modules which provide an
additional set of variables for use in the configuration file. While
the variables in nginx are created and updated across different
modules, there are two modules that are entirely dedicated to
variables: <code>geo</code> and <code>map</code>. The <code>geo</code> module is used to
facilitate tracking of clients based on their IP addresses. This
module can create arbitrary variables that depend on the client's IP
address. The other module, <code>map</code>, allows for the creation of
variables from other variables, essentially providing the ability to
do flexible mappings of hostnames and other run-time variables. This
kind of module may be called the variable handler.</p>

<p>Memory allocation mechanisms implemented inside a single nginx
<code>worker</code> were, to some extent, inspired by Apache. A high-level
description of nginx memory management would be the following: For
each connection, the necessary memory buffers are dynamically
allocated, linked, used for storing and manipulating the header and
body of the request and the response, and then freed upon connection
release. It is very important to note that nginx tries to avoid
copying data in memory as much as possible and most of the data is
passed along by pointer values, not by calling <code>memcpy</code>.</p>

<p>Going a bit deeper, when the response is generated by a module, the
retrieved content is put in a memory buffer which is then added to a
buffer chain link. Subsequent processing works with this buffer chain
link as well. Buffer chains are quite complicated in nginx because
there are several processing scenarios which differ depending on the module
type. For instance, it can be quite tricky to manage the buffers
precisely while implementing a body filter module. Such a module can
only operate on one buffer (chain link) at a time and it must decide
whether to overwrite the input buffer, replace the buffer with a newly
allocated buffer, or insert a new buffer before or after the buffer in
question. To complicate things, sometimes a module will receive
several buffers so that it has an incomplete buffer chain that it must
operate on. However, at this time nginx provides only a low-level API
for manipulating buffer chains, so before doing any actual
implementation a third-party module developer should become really
fluent with this arcane part of nginx.</p>

<p>A note on the above approach is that there are memory buffers allocated for the
entire life of a connection, thus for long-lived connections some extra memory
is kept. At the same time, on an idle keepalive connection, nginx spends
just 550 bytes of memory. A possible optimization for future releases of nginx
would be to reuse and share memory buffers for long-lived connections.</p>

<p>The task of managing memory allocation is done by the nginx pool
allocator. Shared memory areas are used to accept mutex, cache
metadata, the SSL session cache and the information associated with
bandwidth policing and management (limits). There is a slab allocator
implemented in nginx to manage shared memory allocation. To allow
simultaneous safe use of shared memory, a number of locking mechanisms
are available (mutexes and semaphores). In order to organize complex
data structures, nginx also provides a red-black tree
implementation. Red-black trees are used to keep cache metadata in
shared memory, track non-regex location definitions and for a couple of
other tasks.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of the above was never described in a consistent and
simple manner, making the job of developing third-party extensions for
nginx quite complicated. Although some good documents on nginx
internals exist&#x2014;for instance, those produced by Evan Miller&#x2014;such
documents required a huge reverse engineering effort, and the
implementation of nginx modules is still a black art for many.</p>

<p>Despite certain difficulties associated with third-party module
development, the nginx user community recently saw a lot of useful
third-party modules. There is, for instance, an embedded Lua
interpreter module for nginx, additional modules for load balancing,
full WebDAV support, advanced cache control and other interesting
third-party work that the authors of this chapter encourage and will
support in the future.</p>

<h2>14.5. Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>When Igor Sysoev started to write nginx, most of the software enabling
the Internet already existed, and the architecture of such software
typically followed definitions of legacy server and network hardware,
operating systems, and old Internet architecture in general. However,
this didn't prevent Igor from thinking he might be able to improve
things in the web servers area. So, while the first lesson might seem
obvious, it is this: there is always room for improvement.</p>

<p>With the idea of better web software in mind, Igor spent
a lot of time developing the initial code structure and studying
different ways of optimizing the code for a variety of operating
systems. Ten years later he is developing a prototype of nginx version 2.0,
taking into account the years of active development on version 1. 
It is clear that the initial
prototype of a new architecture, and the initial code structure, are vitally
important for the future of a software product.</p>

<p>Another point worth mentioning is that development should be
focused. The Windows version of nginx is probably a good example of
how it is worth avoiding the dilution of development efforts on
something that is neither the developer's core competence or the
target application. It is equally applicable to the rewrite engine
that appeared during several attempts to enhance nginx with more
features for backward compatibility with the existing legacy setups.</p>

<p>Last but not least, it is worth mentioning that despite the fact that
the nginx developer community is not very large, third-party modules
and extensions for nginx have always been a very important part of its
popularity. The work done by Evan Miller, Piotr Sikora, Valery
Kholodkov, Zhang Yichun (agentzh) and other talented software
engineers has been much appreciated by the nginx user community and
its original developers.</p>
