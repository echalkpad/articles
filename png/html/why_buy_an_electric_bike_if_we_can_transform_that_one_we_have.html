In recent years, we have seen how the electric bikes became
popular in the market and became a good option for reducing traffic, environmental
protection and helping to endure for difficult journeys as well.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
The main point for the electric bikes, is the price. They
are obviously more expensive than a regular bike. But we may see developments
for attractive options that make any bike an electric vehicle instantly.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
ShareRoller, it is how we know this attractive project created
in early 2014, but today, in its third version, has been perfected to the point
of being ready to be marketed in bulk.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
ShareRoller is a device placed in front of any bike through
a pull-down mechanism. This small engine is capable of providing up to 750
watts of power, giving speeds of up to 45 km / h and an autonomy which can
range from 12 to 89 kilometers, depending on the battery.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal">
There are three types of batteries to choose producing 110,
220 or 400 watts of power per hour. One of the advantages is that these small
engines are removable, so you can enlarge or diminish the autonomy (and weight)
according to your needs. The battery is recharged in &#xA0;from two hours to two and a half hours
depending from the capacity of the engine.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
ShareRoller also has a software that can be programmed from
an iOS or Android smartphone via a mobile app , where we can check the autonomy
time and distance traveled.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
As an additional point, ShareRoller is portable , and can be
removed from the bike and carried in a backpack for safety. Weight depends on
the type of battery installed, but can range from 800 grams to almost 2
kilograms. Finally, as part of the potability, it has a USB device port to
charge your mobile phone.</div>
