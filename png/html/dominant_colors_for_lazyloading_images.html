<p>Pinterest, Google Images and lots of image-heavy sites lazy-load their content. They also calculate the dominant color of each image to use as a placeholder. This post presents a few methods to do the same and helps you understand the GIF file format to make the most of data URIs.</p>
<p><img src="https://manu.ninja/images/pinterest-placeholders.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>The basic concept is to use a tiny <code class="html">blank.gif</code> as <code>src</code> attribute and replace it with the correct image after the page has fully loaded. The <code class="html">blank.gif</code> can also be set as a Base64-encoded Data URI to save a request.</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs="
 data-src="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/474x/50/1b/74/501b74902935b063816ea8e14f460ca0.jpg"

<p>Pinterest then sets the style of the wrapper to <code class="css">background: #1e1f20;</code> and shows the image with <code class="css">opacity: 1;</code> when it has loaded. They could therefore easily animate the transition, but right now they don&#x2019;t.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-dominant-color-of-an-image">Finding the Dominant Color of an Image</h2>
<p>Finding the dominant colors of an image requires clustering of points in three-dimensional space. I initially planned to indulge in clustering algorithms and write my own <a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/">k-means clustering</a> in JavaScript, but after installing GraphicsMagick for decoding image files of various formats on the server I decided to put this plan off to another day and simply use the <a href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/quantize.html">color quantization</a> of GraphicsMagick.</p>
<p>You are of course free to compare the results of even more sophisticated algorithms and choose the one that is to your liking, but If you want a simpler solution the color quantization of GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick is usually sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="nodejs">Node.js</h3>
<p>The following snippet shows you how to use the <code>gm</code> npm package for finding the dominant color. It is a good idea to resize the image first to soften compression artifacts. This will also speed up the quantization as there is less data to process &#x2013; quantization of a 12 megapixel image (iPhone 6s) takes 13-17 seconds in my benchmarks, whereas first resizing it reduces the time to 3-5 seconds.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var gm = require('gm');

gm('test.jpg')
 .resize(250, 250)
 .colors(1)
 .toBuffer('RGB', function (error, buffer) {
 console.log(buffer.slice(0, 3));
 });
</code></pre>

<h3 id="php">PHP</h3>
<p>The same can of course be accomplished with the <code>imagick</code> extension in PHP. I do know that a <code>gmagick</code> extension exists but the former was already installed on my server.</p>
<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

$image = new Imagick('test.jpg'));
$image-&gt;resizeImage(250, 250, Imagick::FILTER_GAUSSIAN, 1);
$image-&gt;quantizeImage(1, Imagick::COLORSPACE_RGB, 0, false, false);
$image-&gt;setFormat('RGB');
echo substr(bin2hex($image), 0, 6);

<h2 id="deep-dive-into-gifs-and-base64-encoded-data-uris">Deep Dive into GIFs and Base64-encoded Data URIs</h2>
<p>Let&#x2019;s say you have calculated the dominant colors for all your images and your lazy-loading is working smoothly. You can now go a step further and use a different Base64-encoded placeholder for each image, so that you don&#x2019;t need wrappers and the <code>img</code> element itself can be its placeholder. To do this you have to either create lots of GIFs and store them somewhere or create them on the fly, which is what I&#x2019;d like to explain in this section.</p>
<p>If you fire up Photoshop, create a file with 1 &#xD7; 1 pixels in a single color and hit <em>Save For Web</em> you get a GIF which is exactly 43 bytes. I have labeled the binary data in the following snippet for you.</p>
<pre><code>47 49 46 38 39 61 // Header
01 00 01 00 80 00 00 // Logical Screen Descriptor
FF FF FF 00 00 00 // Global Color Table
21 F9 04 00 00 00 00 00 // Graphics Control Extension
2C 00 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 00 // Image Descriptor
02 02 44 01 00 // Image Data
3B // Trailer
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAAAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==
</code></pre>
<p>If you go back to the first snippet in this article you&#x2019;ll notice that the Base64-encoded data URI is a lot longer than Pinterests&#x2019;s. The graphics control extension and the trailer are actually optional. So if you remove them you get a tiny GIF, which is only 34 bytes.</p>
<pre><code>47 49 46 38 39 61 // Header
01 00 01 00 80 01 00 // Logical Screen Descriptor
FF FF FF 00 00 00 // Global Color Table
2C 00 00 00 00 01 00 01 00 00 // Image Descriptor
02 02 44 01 00 // Image Data
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAP///wAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBAA==
</code></pre>
<p>How did Pinterest get a GIF with only 26 bytes? Turns out that you can remove the global color table and the LZW-encoded image data as well. Browsers then just assume a color, which is usually black.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACADs=
</code></pre>
<p>The last thing I want to mention is that Pinterest does not remove the trailer. On the one hand Photoshop, GIMP and possible some browsers report an <em>Unexpected End of File</em> error if there is no trailer present. On the other hand adding it back in does not increase the size of the Base64 string. Why? A Base64 string&#x2019;s length is always a multiple of 4 bytes. The equals symbol is used as a padding at the end of the string. So if you remove the trailer the Base64 string will end in <code>AA==</code> but still have 26 bytes.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAD/ACwAAAAAAQABAAACAA==
</code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-tiny-single-colored-gifs">Creating Tiny Single-Colored GIFs</h2>
<p>The following snippet takes the above knowledge and creates data URIs in the dominant color of a given image. You can achieve the same in PHP by using the <code class="php">pack</code> and <code class="php">base64_encode</code> functions.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var gm = require('gm');

var header = new Buffer('474946383961', 'hex');
var logicalScreenDescriptor = new Buffer('01000100800100', 'hex');
var imageDescriptor = new Buffer('2c000000000100010000', 'hex');
var imageData = new Buffer('0202440100', 'hex');

gm('test.jpg')
 .resize(250, 250)
 .colors(1)
 .toBuffer('RGB', function (error, buffer) {
 var gif = [
 header,
 logicalScreenDescriptor,
 buffer.slice(0, 3),
 new Buffer([0, 0, 0]),
 imageDescriptor,
 imageData
 ];
 console.log('data:image/gif;base64,' + Buffer.concat(gif).toString('base64'));
 });
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-html">data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAEdJRgAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBAA==
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tiny-thumbnails">Tiny Thumbnails</h2>
<p>You can now lazy-load your images and show a tiny GIF in the dominant color as a placeholder, which is embedded in your HTML as a Base64-encoded data URI. The last thing I want to show you is how easily you can now implement the placeholders <a href="https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/">Medium</a> is using.</p>
<p>If you resize your image to 3 &#xD7; 3 pixels and remove the color quantization you get a data URI that is only a bit longer than the single-colored <code class="html">blank.gif</code> but gives you more of a thumbnail for your image. If you then resize your thumbnail to the image dimensions you may have to use <code>filter: blur(&#x2026;);</code> to soften artifacts but you can see in the image below that Chrome does an excellent job in upscaling tiny thumbnails.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var gm = require('gm');

gm('test.jpg')
 .resize(3, 3)
 .toBuffer('GIF', function (error, buffer) {
 console.log('data:image/gif;base64,' + buffer.toString('base64'));
 });
</code></pre>

I&#x2019;ve started working on a WordPress plugin called <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/dominant-colors-lazy-loading/">Dominant Colors Lazy Loading</a> which uses the above concepts. The code is on <a href="https://github.com/Lorti/dominant-colors-lazy-loading-wordpress-plugin">GitHub</a> and I'd very much appreciate your feedback and pull requests. The plugin is currently in its early stages but I plan on adding several features which are outlined in the repository.
