						Cheat sheets; don&#x2019;t you just love them? <p>

I love them as they offer me a simple way to recall a software program or help me to learn a new skill. Plus there&#x2019;s always a useful keyboard shortcut to forget, a command you will just fail to remember, a newly introduced function that slips your mind or element you cease to think of.</p><p>

So to get things rolling with my up and coming series of HTML5 tutorials and guides which I will be sharing on MakeaWebsiteHub.com I have spent the last few days creating this &#x201C;Mega&#x201D; cheat sheet for all you front end types to get your little hands on. So whether you are a web design novice or a seasoned grizzly veteran this will hopefully come in use for your next project.</p><p>
