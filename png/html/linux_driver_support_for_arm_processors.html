			My company sells a product that uses DisplayLink monitors and BeagleBones together. Unfortunately, the current driver UDLFB only supports the USB2 monitors. The new driver for Ubuntu does support the USB3 but ONLY for x86/64 chipsets.<br>
<br>
We're looking for ARM processor support for the USB3 monitors. I can compile the kernel and/or any other drivers that we need but the recently released Ubuntu/USB3 driver has a closed source binary blob which is key to making the monitors work. This binary blob is currently ONLY supported on x86/64.<br>
<br>
Will there be any support for ARM (whether source code or a binary)?
