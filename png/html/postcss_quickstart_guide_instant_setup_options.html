<div><div class="post-body__content"><p>Welcome to the &#x201C;PostCSS Deep Dive: QuickStart Guide&#x201D;. Throughout these first posts of our series, we&#x2019;re going to look at getting you started with PostCSS in the quickest, most efficient ways possible.</p><p>In this tutorial we&#x2019;re going to start with instant setup options, so you can be working with PostCSS in mere minutes from now. At present we have&#xA0;two instant setup options: CodePen and Prepros.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s see how you can use them both to start playing with PostCSS right away.</p><h2>PostCSS via CodePen</h2><p>If you&#x2019;re brand new to PostCSS the fastest way to start using it&#xA0;is via <a href="http://codepen.io/" rel="external" target="_blank">CodePen</a>.</p><p>CodePen now has pre-integrated support for PostCSS, along with&#xA0;the following plugins and packs:</p><p>This selection of plugins gives you support for future syntax, Sass-like functionality, comment stripping, and the ability to write transform code in shorthand.</p><p>Start by going to CodePen and <a href="http://codepen.io/pen/" rel="external" target="_blank">creating a new pen</a>. Then click the little gear icon at the top left of the CSS window to bring up the settings panel.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/cssgearicon.png"></figure><p>From the dropdown labelled <strong>CSS Preprocessor</strong> select the <strong>PostCSS</strong> option. You can also check the radio button labelled <strong>Autoprefixer</strong> to have that plugin included.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/postcssoncodepen.png"></figure><p>After making this selection you should now see a small black button below the dropdown labelled <strong>Need an add-on?</strong>. Click that button and a panel will open up displaying a list of <code class="inline">@</code> rules. Copy and paste any of these <code class="inline">@</code> rules into your CSS panel to start using the corresponding PostCSS plugin.</p><figure class="post_image"> <img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/atrulescodepen.png"></figure><h3>Example of CodePen Usage</h3><p>Let&#x2019;s see an example of how we might use the available PostCSS plugins with CodePen, starting with the <em>cssnext</em> pack.</p><p>At the top of the CSS panel, add this code to specify you want to use cssnext:</p><pre class="brush: css noskimlinks noskimwords">@use cssnext;</pre><p>With this line in place, you will now have the ability to use all the functionality described at <a href="http://cssnext.io/features">http://cssnext.io/features</a>. We&#x2019;re going to use the CSS <a href="http://cssnext.io/features/#custom-properties-var" rel="external" target="_blank">variable</a> and <a href="http://cssnext.io/features/#color" rel="external" target="_blank">color</a> functions to set a color on the body background.</p><p>First, we setup a <code class="inline">:root</code> section and define a CSS variable in it. Add this to your CSS panel:</p><pre class="brush: css noskimlinks noskimwords">:root {
 --body_bg_color: black;
}</pre><p>Now we can use that variable in our CSS by adding this code below:</p><pre class="brush: css noskimlinks noskimwords">body {
 background: var(--body_bg_color);
}</pre><p>At this point you should have just seen the background of your pen turn black. You can also click the <strong>View Compiled</strong> button at the top of your CSS panel to see the code that has been generated:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/compiled.png"><figcaption>&#x201C;View Compiled&#x201D; showing code after processing with PostCSS</figcaption></figure><p>Now let&#x2019;s say we find that hard black a little to stark for a design we&#x2019;re working on and we want to lighten it a bit. To adjust the color we can use the <em>future syntax</em> that allows for color modification.</p><p>On the line that declares the <code class="inline">--body_bg_color</code> variable, change the value from <code class="inline">black</code> to:</p><pre class="brush: plain noskimlinks noskimwords">--body_bg_color: color(black lightness(20%));</pre><p>This color function lightens the black color by 20%. You should now see your pen&#x2019;s background has changed to a dark grey.</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/darkgrey.png"></figure><p>Any of the supported plugins can be used on CodePen in the same way:</p><ol>
<li>Include the <code class="inline">@</code> rule for the plugin you want to use</li>
<li>Start using the plugin in your CSS according to its instructions (you&#x2019;ll find the links above)</li>
</ol><p>Here&#x2019;s the (visually unremarkable) demo we&#x2019;ve just built:</p>





<h2>PostCSS via Prepros</h2><p>Prepros may not have the range of plugin support that CodePen has, but it does include seamless activation of both <em>Autoprefixer</em> and <em>cssnext</em>. Prepros can be downloaded from <a href="https://prepros.io">https://prepros.io</a>.</p><p>To get started, drag and drop a project that includes a CSS file into the interface. Then click on the CSS file&#x2019;s name to open up a panel of settings on the right hand side. From here, you can check the boxes labeled <strong>AutoPrefix CSS</strong> in order to enable Autoprefixer, and <strong>Enable Cssnext</strong> in order to use cssnext:</p><figure class="post_image"><img alt="" src="https://cms-assets.tutsplus.com/uploads/users/53/posts/24536/image/postcssprepros.png"></figure><p>You&#x2019;ll now be able to use all the functionality of the <a href="http://cssnext.io/features/" rel="external" target="_blank">cssnext</a> plugin pack, as well as having your CSS autoprefixed.</p><h2>Let&#x2019;s Recap</h2><p>Okay, let&#x2019;s quickly sum up what we&#x2019;ve covered above:</p><ul>
<li>To get your PostCSS feet wet, try CodePen or Prepros for instant setup</li>
<li>CodePen offers ten plugins/packs you can use</li>
<li>Activate PostCSS in CodePen&#x2019;s CSS settings, then use <code class="inline">@</code> rules to enable specific plugins</li>
<li>Prepros offers the Autoprefixer plugin and cssnext pack</li>
<li>Activate these two in the settings for any CSS file in a Prepros project</li>
</ul><h2>Up Next: Task Runner Integration</h2><p>CodePen and Prepros are two great ways to get up and running with PostCSS almost instantly. However, the downside is that&#xA0;you don&#x2019;t get to decide which plugins to use.</p><p>When you&#x2019;re ready to tap into the full power of PostCSS you&#x2019;ll want to choose and configure your own selection of plugins. Probably the most accessible way to do this is through setting up custom PostCSS projects via task runners such as <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Gulp</a> or <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Grunt</a>.</p><p>You&#x2019;ll learn how just how to go about that in the next two tutorials, &#x201C;Quickstart Guide: Gulp Setup&#x201D; and &#x201C;Quickstart Guide: Grunt Setup&#x201D;.</p></div></div>
