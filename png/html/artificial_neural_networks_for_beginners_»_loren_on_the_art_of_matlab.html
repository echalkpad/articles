<div><div class="content"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning">Deep Learning</a> is a very hot topic these days especially in computer vision applications and you probably see it in the news and get curious. Now the question is, how do you get started with it? Today's guest blogger, Toshi Takeuchi, gives us a quick tutorial on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network">artificial neural networks</a> as a starting point for your study of deep learning.</p><h3>Contents</h3><h4>MNIST Dataset<a name="1168dbb4-1365-4b63-8326-140263e2072f"></a></h4><p>Many of us tend to learn better with a concrete example. Let me give you a quick step-by-step tutorial to get intuition using a popular <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html">MNIST handwritten digit dataset</a>. Kaggle happens to use this very dataset in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer">Digit Recognizer</a> tutorial competition. Let's use it in this example. You can download the competition dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data">"Get the Data"</a> page:</p><p><ul><li>train.csv - training data</li><li>test.csv - test data for submission</li></ul></p><p>Load the training and test data into MATLAB, which I assume was downloaded into the current folder. The test data is used to generate your submissions.</p><pre class="codeinput">tr = csvread(<span class="string">'train.csv'</span>, 1, 0); 
sub = csvread(<span class="string">'test.csv'</span>, 1, 0); 
</pre><p>The first column is the label that shows the correct digit for each sample in the dataset, and each row is a sample. In the remaining columns, a row represents a 28 x 28 image of a handwritten digit, but all pixels are placed in a single row, rather than in the original rectangular form. To visualize the digits, we need to reshape the rows into 28 x 28 matrices. You can use <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/reshape.html">reshape</a> for that, except that we need to transpose the data, because <tt>reshape</tt> operates by column-wise rather than row-wise.</p><pre class="codeinput">figure

The app expects two sets of data:</p><p><ul><li>inputs - a numeric matrix, each column representing the samples and rows the features. This is the scanned images of handwritten digits.</li><li>targets - a numeric matrix of 0 and 1 that maps to specific labels that images represent. This is also known as a dummy variable. Neural Network Toolbox also expects labels stored in columns, rather than in rows.</li></ul></p><p>The labels range from 0 to 9, but we will use '10' to represent '0' because MATLAB is indexing is 1-based.</p><pre class="language-matlab">1 --&gt; [1; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0]

 :
0 --&gt; [0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 0; 1]
</pre><p>The dataset stores samples in rows rather than in columns, so you need to transpose it. Then you will partition the data so that you hold out 1/3 of the data for model evaluation, and you will only use 2/3 for training our artificial neural network model.</p><pre class="codeinput">n = size(tr, 1); 
targets = tr(:,1); 
targets(targets == 0) = 10;

targets = targets'; 
targetsd = targetsd';

c = cvpartition(n,<span class="string">'Holdout'</span>,n/3);

Ytrain = targetsd(:, training(c));

</pre><h4>Network Architecture<a name="f518ac98-768f-48c5-a6dd-e3769161e2a2"></a></h4><p>You probably noticed that the artificial neural network model generated from the Pattern Recognition Tool has only one hidden layer. You can build a custom model with more layers if you would like, but this simple architecture is sufficient for most common problems.</p><p>The next question you may ask is how I picked 100 for the number of hidden neurons. The general rule of thumb is to pick a number between the number of input neurons, 784 and the number of output neurons, 10, and I just picked 100 arbitrarily. That means you might do better if you try other values. Let's do this programmatically this time. <tt>myNNscript.m</tt> will be handy for this - you can simply adapt the script to do a parameter sweep.</p><pre class="codeinput">sweep = [10,50:50:300];

models = cell(length(sweep), 1);

t = Ytrain;

 net = patternnet(hiddenLayerSize); 
 net.divideParam.trainRatio = 70/100;
 net.divideParam.valRatio = 15/100; 
 net.divideParam.testRatio = 15/100; 
 net = train(net, x, t);

 [~, p] = max(p); 
 scores(i) = sum(Ytest == p) /<span class="keyword">...</span>
 length(Ytest);

</pre><p>Let's now plot how the categorization accuracy changes versus number of neurons in the hidden layer.</p><pre class="codeinput">figure

</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/images/loren/2015/neuralnetFinal_03.png" alt=""> <p>It looks like you get the best result around 250 neurons and the best score will be around 0.96 with this basic artificial neural network model.</p><p>As you can see, you gain more accuracy if you increase the number of hidden neurons, but then the accuracy decreases at some point (your result may differ a bit due to random initialization of weights). As you increase the number of neurons, your model will be able to capture more features, but if you capture too many features, then you end up overfitting your model to the training data and it won't do well with unseen data. Let's examine the learned weights with 300 hidden neurons. You see more details, but you also see more noise.</p><pre class="codeinput">net = models{end};

What if we use the inputs as the target values? That eliminates the need for training labels and turns this into an unsupervised learning algorithm. This is known as an autoencoder and this becomes a building block of a deep learning network. There is an excellent example of autoencoders on the <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/nnet/examples/training-a-deep-neural-network-for-digit-classification.html">Training a Deep Neural Network for Digit Classification</a> page in the Neural Network Toolbox documentation, which also uses MNIST dataset. For more details, Stanford provides an excellent <a href="http://deeplearning.stanford.edu/tutorial/">UFLDL Tutorial</a> that also uses the same dataset and MATLAB-based starter code.</p><h4>Sudoku Solver: a Real-time Processing Example<a name="91869b46-1d87-4662-a74e-3ae83ec310b8"></a></h4><p>Beyond understanding the algorithms, there is also a practical question of how to generate the input data in the first place. Someone spent a lot of time to prepare the MNIST dataset to ensure uniform sizing, scaling, contrast, etc. To use the model you built from this dataset in practical applications, you have to be able to repeat the same set of processing on new data. How do you do such preparation yourself?</p><p>There is a fun video that shows you how you can solve Sudoku puzzles using a webcam that uses a different character recognition technique. Instead of static images, our colleague <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/profile/authors/1905880-teja-muppirala">Teja Muppirala</a> uses a live video feed in real time to do it and he walks you through the pre-processing steps one by one. You should definitely check it out: <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/videos/solving-a-sudoku-puzzle-using-a-webcam-68773.html">Solving a Sudoku Puzzle Using a Webcam</a>.</p><p><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="http://blogs.mathworks.com/images/loren/2015/solveSudokuWebcam.png" alt=""> </p><h4>Submitting Your Entry to Kaggle<a name="b7442718-32fb-4db8-9016-93a0e71903a6"></a></h4><p>You got 96% categorization accuracy rate by simply accepting the default settings except for the number of hidden neurons. Not bad for the first try. Since you are using a Kaggle dataset, you can now submit your result to Kaggle.</p><pre class="codeinput">n = size(sub, 1);

We didn&#x2019;t go into details such as how the inputs weights and bias units are combined, how activation works, how you train such a network, etc. But you now know enough to use Neural Network Toolbox in MATLAB to participate in a Kaggle competition.</p><p><br><a href=""><span>Get
