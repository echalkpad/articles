<p>I'm still new to Docker, and the hype is real - it's a really compelling technology. Docker provides a unique way of isolating services and their dependencies. </p>

<p>This blog is running on containers!</p>

<h2 id="theproject">The Project</h2>

<p>This blog is running on 3 Docker containers running:</p>

<ul>
<li>Node.js and the Ghost blog software</li>
<li>NGINX - proxying port 80 calls to the Node web server on port 2368</li>
<li>MySQL database</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see in the diagram, we have the Docker engine installed on Ubuntu on a server, and 3 containers running in the docker engine environment.</p>

<p>Here's the entire setup if you want to use the same for your own blog:</p>

 



<p>I'm a <a href="https://startupnextdoor.com/from-wordpress-to-jekyll-to-ghost/">big fan of Ghost</a> as a blogging system. It's simple and fast, and is made just for blogging.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mw6vgfxwlz2a.cloudfront.net/2016/Feb/ghost_logo_small-1455828665539.png" alt="Ghost blog"></p>

<p>Clone the project above onto a server, install Docker, and in a few seconds you'll have a running blog. <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/docker-ghost-template">Setup instructions here</a>. Since the project uses S3 and Cloudfront for images, the only thing that will take you a bit to set up is making an S3 bucket and a Cloudfront distribution.</p>

<h2 id="aboutdocker">About Docker</h2>

<p>Docker creates "containers" which run a single service in isolation. A service is basically a single process. A service could be a Redis instance, Memcache, MySQL, Apache, any number of things. But it's one process. When the container starts, the process starts, and when the process stops the container stops.</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Docker containers run one process, so they do one thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Containers can easily connect to each other using "links". Linking containers means they can communicate with each other over the network. Each container can expose a port to allow connections.</p>

<h2 id="theoldway">The Old Way</h2>

<p>The old way, which still works great (I use it every day) but can be cumbersome, is to have a server set up for a few things. For example, a web server running an application:</p>

<p>The server is running:</p>

<ul>
<li>OS: Ubuntu</li>
<li>Web server: Apache or NGINX</li>
<li>Application processes: Python, PHP, etc.</li>
<li>Caching: Redis, Memcache, etc.</li>
<li>SSH: so you can log in remotely</li>
</ul>

<p>You may perhaps have a database on the same server if it's a small operation.</p>

<p>Setting up each server, doing updates, and maintaining them to work together can be a pain over time.</p>

<h2 id="thedockerway">The Docker Way</h2>

<p>By isolating a service within a container, it's easy to replace an old, outdated container with a new one. Or if you need 7 containers that do the same thing, just spawn 7 of them.</p>

<p>Each service is small. Each doesn't have the overhead of an entire OS. Each container has an OS, which is specified by the container's author, but if you have 4 containers running the same version of Ubuntu, you don't have 4 operating systems taking up 4 times the space on the same host. They only take up the space of one. Docker accomplishes this through the use of the <strong>union file system</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnionFS">UnionFS</a>). As a container is built, it creates layers. Identical layers are shared with other containers, so the space needed is minimized. </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Unionfs is a filesystem service for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD which implements a union mount for other file systems. It allows files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid, forming a single coherent file system. Contents of directories which have the same path within the merged branches will be seen together in a single merged directory, within the new, virtual filesystem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most containers don't run a full-blown OS. Many use a bare-bones distribution like Alpine or Busybox. Alpine only takes 5 MB.</p>

<p>Here's an example of the layers that build up on two containers shown side-by-side, one built on Busybox and one on Debian, but sharing a kernel.</p>

<p><img src="https://d2mw6vgfxwlz2a.cloudfront.net/2016/Feb/docker_unionfs_4-1455834185704.png" alt="layers in UnionFS"></p>

<p>Containers are the writeable layer that sit atop an image. An image is the blueprint of a container.</p>

<p>Containers build upon each other. One will start with just an OS, and add its own service on top. Then another container can use that container as a base, and augment the given service. Yet another container can use that one as a base for its service. Each hierarchy creates a layer on the union file system.</p>

<h3 id="whycontainersandwhynow">Why containers and why now?</h3>

<p>Microservices are all the rage right now. Microservices are single-purpose services that accomplish one task in the vast scheme of an enterprise datacenter. They are self-contained, and usually manager their own data so they have no external dependencies. A service receives a request or a message, and does a task, and then waits for the next. When a new service rolls out to replace the original, you can divert traffic from the old service to the new one, and eventually kill off the old service. </p>

<p>This contrasts with deploying services to servers, and later re-deploying to the same servers. With servers being so cheap and disposable nowadays, it's easier to spin up a new server, run a container on it, and migrate traffic to it. Over time, you end up on newer, faster hardware, with better services.</p>

<p>There's a lot to cover in terms of microservices. I won't go into more detail here, but you can see where microservices and containers seem to be made for each other. They both fit a philosophy of disposable, temporary, single-purpose services that evolve over time.</p>

<h2 id="dockercompose">Docker Compose</h2>

<p><img src="https://d2mw6vgfxwlz2a.cloudfront.net/2016/Feb/docker_compose-1455828340047.png" alt="Docker Compose"></p>

<p>Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a Compose file to configure your application's services. Then, using a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.</p>

<p>All the service-to-service network connections are laid out in the docker-compose.yml file, <a href="https://github.com/jwasham/docker-ghost-template/blob/master/docker-compose.yml">as you can see here</a>. This is much easier than running containers and setting the network settings (links to other containers) on the command line.</p>

<p>Docker-compose brings up all the services together, and brings them down together gracefully.</p>

<h2 id="learningmore">Learning More</h2>

<p>Docker has a <a href="https://training.docker.com/self-paced-training">few tutorial videos</a> on their site to get you started.</p>

<p>I got my start with this comprehensive book by Adrian Mouat: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-Docker-Developing-Deploying-Containers/dp/1491915765">Using Docker</a>. Published in 2016, it has up-to-date coverage of Docker. It's a great start and my go-to reference.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Using-Docker-Developing-Deploying-Containers/dp/1491915765"><img src="https://d2mw6vgfxwlz2a.cloudfront.net/2016/Feb/using_docker_2-1455827593978.png" alt="Using Docker by Adrian Mouat" title=""></a></p>

<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>

<p>I would recommend changing the memory used by MySQL. It tends to take up a lot of memory, even when that memory is not needed. You can set a limit in the docker-compose.yml before you start the containers the first time, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">mysql: 
 container_name: blog_data
 mem_limit: 150m
 image: mysql:5.7.10
 expose:
 - "3306"
</code></pre>

<p>If you start the containers first and then add this later, it will create a new container for MySQL and discard the old one.</p>
