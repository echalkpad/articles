			<p>No company <em>has</em> a culture; every company <em>is</em> a culture. A startup is a team of people on a mission, and a good culture is just what that looks like on the inside. The first team that I built has become known in Silicon Valley as the &#x201C;PayPal Mafia&#x201D; because so many of my former colleagues, including Elon Musk, Reid Hoffman, and David Sacks, have gone on to help each other start and invest in successful tech companies. </p>

I had seen the mixed results of that approach when I worked at a New York law firm. The relationships between lawyers I worked with were oddly thin. They spent all day together, but few of them seemed to have much to say to each other outside the office. </p>
<p>Why work with a group of people who don&#x2019;t even like each other? Taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents check in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: It&#x2019;s not even rational. Since time is your most valuable asset, it&#x2019;s odd to spend it working with people who don&#x2019;t envision any long&#x2011;term future together. </p>
<h3>Rule 1: The Best Startups Work a Lot Like Cults</h3>
<p>In the most intense kind of organization, members abandon the outside world and hang out only with other members. We have a word for such organizations: cults. Cultures of total dedication look crazy from the outside. But entrepreneurs should take cultures of extreme dedication seriously. </p>
<p>The extreme opposite of a cult is a consulting firm like Accenture: not only does it lack a distinctive mission, but individual consultants are regularly dropping in and out of companies to which they have no long&#x2011;term connection whatsoever.</p>
<p>Every company culture can be plotted on a linear spectrum:<br>
<img src="http://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/zero_to_one_graph.png" alt="zero_to_one_graph" width="492" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1574697"></p>
<p>The best startups might be considered slightly less extreme kinds of cults. The biggest difference is that cults tend to be fanatically <em>wrong</em> about something important. People at a successful startup are fanatically <em>right</em> about something those outside it have missed. </p>
<h3>Rule 2: Giving People a Chance to &#x201C;Change the World&#x201D; Is a Lousy Way to Recruit Employees</h3>
<p>Recruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced. Talented people don&#x2019;t need to work for you; they have plenty of options. You should ask yourself: <em>Why would someone join your company as its 20th engineer when she could go work at Google for more money and more prestige?</em></p>
<p>Here are some bad answers: &#x201C;Your stock options will be worth more here than elsewhere.&#x201D; &#x201C;You&#x2019;ll get to work with the smartest people in the world.&#x201D; &#x201C;You can help solve the world&#x2019;s most challenging problems.&#x201D; Every company makes these same claims, so they won&#x2019;t help you stand out. </p>
<p>You&#x2019;ll attract the employees you need if you can explain why your mission is compelling: not why it&#x2019;s important in general, but why you&#x2019;re doing something important that no one else is going to get done. However, even a great mission is not enough. The best recruit will also wonder: &#x201C;Are these the kind of people I want to work with?&#x201D; You should be able to explain why your company is a unique match for him personally. And if you can&#x2019;t do that, he&#x2019;s probably not the right match.</p>
<h3>Rule 3: Everyone at Your Startup Should Have Just One Job</h3>
<p>Internal peace is what enables a startup to survive at all. But most fights inside a company happen when colleagues compete for the same responsibilities. Startups face an especially high risk of this since job roles are fluid at the early stages. </p>
<p>The best thing I did as a manager at PayPal was to make every person in the company responsible for doing just one thing. I had started doing this just to simplify the task of managing people. But then I noticed a deeper result: Defining roles reduced conflict. Eliminating competition makes it easier for everyone to build the kinds of long&#x2011;term relationships that transcend mere professionalism.</p>
<h3>Rule 4: Hire Employees Who Are Excited to Wear Your Logo on Their Hoodies</h3>
<p>Startups have limited resources and small teams. They must work quickly and efficiently in order to survive, and that&#x2019;s easier to do when everyone shares an understanding of the world.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s a clich&#xE9; that tech workers don&#x2019;t care about what they wear, but if you look closely at the T&#x2011;shirts people in Mountain View and Palo Alto wear to work, you&#x2019;ll see the logos of their companies&#x2014;and tech workers care about those very much. The startup uniform encapsulates a simple but essential principle: Everyone at your company should be different in the same way&#x2014;a tribe of like&#x2011;minded people fiercely devoted to the company&#x2019;s mission.</p>
<p>Above all, don&#x2019;t fight the perk war. Anybody who would be powerfully swayed by free laundry pickup or pet day care would be a bad addition to your team. Just cover the basics and then promise what no others can: the opportunity to do irreplaceable work on a unique problem alongside great people.</p>
