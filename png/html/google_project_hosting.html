 <h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#Introduction" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>This document will guide you through your first steps with Pyrit. <strong>Before continuing, you should have Pyrit installed and working.</strong> See the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Installation">Installation</a>-Wiki for details. You will also need to have <a href="http://www.secdev.org/projects/scapy/" rel="nofollow">Scapy</a> installed, which should come with your distribution or may be installed from source. Pyrit can use <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a> to access various kinds of SQL-databases and you'll need to have it installed if you want to try that feature as explained below. </p><p>You should also take a look at the <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/ReferenceManual">manual</a> when new commands get introduced below; more information and details about the features a command provides are given there. </p><p>Throughout this tutorial we will refer to files and examples that are distributed together with Pyrit's source-code. Therefore the first step is to get yourself a copy of <a href="http://pyrit.googlecode.com/files/pyrit-0.3.0.tar.gz" rel="nofollow">the source-code tarball</a>, unpack it and switch to the /test-directory: </p><pre class="prettyprint">wget http://pyrit.googlecode.com/files/pyrit-0.3.0.tar.gz
tar xvzf pyrit-0.3.0.tar.gz
cd pyrit-0.3.0/test</pre><p>You should find three files within this directory that will be of interest for us: </p><ul><li><i>dict.gz</i> is a gzip-compressed wordlist </li><li><i>wpa2psk-linksys.dump.gz</i> is a gzip-compressed dump of a WPA2-PSK handshake </li><li><i>wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz</i> is a gzip-compressed dump a WPA-PSK handshake </li></ul><h2><a name="First_steps_with_capture-files_and_wordlists"></a>First steps with capture-files and wordlists<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#First_steps_with_capture-files_and_wordlists" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>Pyrit can understand packet capture files in pcap-format. These files basically contain what was captured from the air. Our first meaningful step in this tutorial is to let Pyrit analyze one of the capture files and give us some information about the content. </p><h2><a name="Analyzing_a_capture_file"></a>Analyzing a capture file<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#Analyzing_a_capture_file" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>Issue to following command to analyze the file <i>wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz</i>: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pyrit -r wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz analyze</pre><p> Pyrit should answer with output very similar like the following: </p><pre class="prettyprint">Pyrit 0.3.0 (C) 2008-2010 Lukas Lueg http://pyrit.googlecode.com

Parsing file 'wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz' (1/1)...
587 packets (587 802.11-packets), 1 APs

#1: AccessPoint 00:0b:86:c2:a4:85 ('linksys')
 #0: Station 00:13:ce:55:98:ef, handshake found
 #1: Station 01:00:5e:7f:ff:fa
 #2: Station 01:00:5e:00:00:16</pre><p>Pyrit has successfuly parsed the capture file and found one AccessPoint with BSSID <i>00:0b:86:c2:a4:85</i> and ESSID <i>'linksys'</i> and three Stations communicating with that AccessPoint. The key-negotiation (known as the fourway-handshake) between the Station with MAC <i>00:13:ce:55:98:ef</i> and the AccessPoint has also been recorded in the capture file. We can use the data from this handshake to guess that password that is used to protect the network. </p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that Pyrit can transparently read/write gzip-compressed files; this becomes very handy when dealing with large wordlists or cowpatty-files that may take hundrets of megabytes. </p><h2><a name="Attacking_a_handshake_and_revealing_the_password"></a>Attacking a handshake and revealing the password<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#Attacking_a_handshake_and_revealing_the_password" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>We now use the example wordlist <i>dict.gz</i> and let Pyrit guess the password that was used in the key-negotiation between AccessPoint <i>00:0b:86:c2:a4:85</i> and Station <i>00:13:ce:55:98:ef</i>. The correct password should get detected, if it is part of the list. In our terms, this is known as a "passthrough-attack". Issue the following command: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pyrit -r wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz -i dict.gz -b 00:0b:86:c2:a4:85 attack_passthrough</pre><p>This tells Pyrit to take the capture-file <i>wpapsk-linksys.dump.gz</i> and attack the key-negotiation with AccessPoint <i>00:0b:86:c2:a4:85</i> using the dictionary-file <i>dict.gz</i>. </p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that you do not always have to tell Pyrit which AccessPoint to choose from the capture-file - Pyrit will usually be able to figure that out by itself. </p><p>You should get a response very similar to the following: </p><pre class="prettyprint">Pyrit 0.3.0 (C) 2008-2010 Lukas Lueg http://pyrit.googlecode.com

For our purpose, we are only interested in a very tiny fraction of the traffic between AccessPoint and Station. Pyrit can help reducing the size of a packet-capture file by analyzing the traffic and throwing away all packets that are of no use for us. We end up with a new, very small capture file that still holds all valuable information and is useable with other tools like <i>Wireshark</i>. </p><p><strong>Please note</strong> that stripping a capture file is not necessary. It's sole purpose is to make life a little easier when it comes to large capture files. </p><p>Our original example has 587 packets and a size of roughly 13kb.

New pcap-file 'wpapsk-linksys_stripped.dump.gz' written (4 out of 587 packets)</pre><p>The new capture file <i>wpapsk-linksys_stripped.dump.gz</i> has a size of only a few hundred bytes and contains only three from the key-negotiation (used to attack the password) and one beacon-frame (used to detect the network's ESSID). </p><h2><a name="Working_with_Pyrit's_database"></a>Working with Pyrit's database<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#Working_with_Pyrit's_database" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>As you may already know, guessing the password used in a WPA(2)-PSK key-negotiation is a computational-intensive task. During this process, more than 99.9% of the CPU-cycles have to be spent to compute what is known as the <i>Pairwise Master Key</i>, a 256-bit key derived from the ESSID and a password using the PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA1-algorithm. One of the major weaknesses of WPA(2)-PSK is that the <i>Pairwise Master Key</i> has no elements that are unique to the moment of the key-negotiation between AccessPoint and Station. It is therefor possible to pre-compute the <i>Pairwise Master Key</i> and store it for later use. In the moment of attacking a key-negotiation, we are left with the remaining 0.1% of what depends on session-unique data. It is therefore extremely valueable for an attacker to pre-compute large tables of <i>Pairwise Master Keys</i> for common ESSIDs. </p><p>This is where Pyrit's database kicks in. It can store ESSIDs, passwords and their corresponding <i>Pairwise Master Keys</i>, possibly growing to the size of hundrets of millions of entries. Starting with a fresh installation of Pyrit, your database will most probably be empty. Issue the following command to get an overview: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pyrit eval</pre><p>Pyrit should respond like this: </p><pre class="prettyprint">Pyrit 0.3.0 (C) 2008-2010 Lukas Lueg http://pyrit.googlecode.com

The password is 'dictionary'.</pre><p>Again, the password protecting the network has been revealed. </p><p>While our example uses an extremely small wordlist and the performance-numbers are thereby not very reliable, attacking a handshake from a database of pre-computed <i>Pairwise Master Keys</i> will usually crunch through more than one million passwords per second. You can also run a database-attack against the second capture file <i>'wpa2psk-linksys.dump.gz'</i>, which will also take use of the pre-computed <i>Pairwise Master Keys</i>. </p><h2><a name="Scaling_up:_Using_a_SQL-database_as_storage"></a>Scaling up: Using a SQL-database as storage<a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyrit/wiki/Tutorial#Scaling_up:_Using_a_SQL-database_as_storage" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p>Using a SQL-database instead of the filesystem will give you some benefits: </p><ul><li>Real ACID-compliance, backup- and load-balancing-features. </li><li>Multiple Pyrit-clients can operate on the same database at the same time over the network. </li><li>Meta- and binary-data are (possibly) stored independent of each other, making the database easier to query and operate on. </li></ul><p>Pyrit uses <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLAlchemy</a> and can therefor use all kinds of SQL-databases for it's internal storage mechanism: <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" rel="nofollow">SQLite</a> has all the benefits described above (except the network-functionality), <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQL</a> and <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/" rel="nofollow">PostgreSQL</a> require some setup but provide more features and better scaling.

All done.</pre><p>Setting up a MySQL- or PostreSQL-server is beyond the scope of this tutorial. However, after setting up the database-server, creating a (empty) database and providing the necessary credentials, the required steps in Pyrit are the same as above. For example, to use the (already created) database <i>'pyrit'</i> on a PostgreSQL-server at 192.168.0.7 with user <i>'pyrit'</i> and no password, your commandline would look something like this: </p><pre class="prettyprint">pyrit -u postgres://pyrit:@192.168.0.7/pyrit -e linksys create_essid</pre><p>To make life a little easier, you can save the default connection-string in Pyrit's configuration-file at <i>'~/.pyrit/config'</i>. Change the value of the key <i>default_storage</i> to a new connection-string and you won't have to supply it every single time. </p>
