<p>
<span>One
great language feature of Go is that it has a built-in testing
package for writing tests and the command-line tool go test for
running them. This means if you want your Go code to have automated
tests, you don't need to download any extra tools to run tests. Not
only that, but the main testing library is very simple, so your tests
are just regular Go code.</span></p>

<p>
<span>If
you're learning Go, and especially if you are learning testing for
the first time, this tutorial is for you. It's also for programmers
who are experienced in another language, but are trying to figure out
testing for the first time.</span></p>


<p>
<b><span>Why
automated testing?</span></b></p>


<p>
<span><span>If
you haven't written automated tests before, you might wonder why
people do automated tests. On my early web development projects, I
didn't write tests and relied solely on my eyeballs to confirm that
my code worked, but as a result, I missed a lot of glaring errors.
Here are some reasons why you should have automated tests in your
code:</span></span></p>
<br>
<ul><div>
<li>
<p>
<span>The
 obvious one: So you know your code works</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span>As
 your projects grow, simply relying on the eyeball test takes <b>forever</b>
 and you're more likely to miss bugs in your code</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span>As
 your projects grow, your tests can show exactly when a bug shows up
 in part of your code so you can fix it. This lets you <b>detect bugs
 early</b> in the development cycle!</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span>Writing
 tests makes you think clearly about what your code's really <b>supposed
 to</b> do</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<span>In
 the Go community, your tests can serve as &#x201C;the other
 documentation&#x201D; for showing people examples of how to use your code</span></p>
</li>
</div></ul>

<br>
<div>
<span><span>At
<a href="https://www.meta.sc/">Meta Search</a>, where I work, we write a lot of automated tests for all
these reasons, and our tests contribute a lot to how we can get code
out on an enormous codebase very quickly and reliably. So without
further ado, let's write some tests!</span></span><br>
<span><span><br></span>

</span>
<br>
<p>
<b><span><span><span>A
full name first example</span></span></span></b></p>

<p>
<span><span>For
a first example, let's say we have a Go function that takes someone's
first and last name and returns their full name. Write this into
<span><span>fullname.go</span></span>:</span></span></p>

<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">package testingtutorial

func FullName(firstName, lastName string) string {
 return firstName + lastName
}</code></span></pre>


<div>
<span><span><span>This
function is supposed to return a string of someone's full name, so if
I pass in my name and call <span><span>F</span></span><span><span>ullName("</span></span><span><span>And</span></span><span><span>y",
"Haskell")</span></span>, the string of test I want back is
<span><span>"</span></span><span><span>And</span></span><span><span>y
Haskell"</span></span>. Functions like this are common on
websites, for example when they are displaying your full name on a
social media profile. But there's a bug in this function, and a test
will reveal it.</span></span></span><p>
<span><span><span><span><b><span>Testing our function</span></b></span></span></span></span></p>


<br><span><span>As I mentioned, we have an example of something we'd put into the function (my first and last name) and what we expect to get back. That means we know enough to write a test for this function. Put this into <span><span>fullname_test.go:</span></span></span></span>


<pre><code class="language-go">package testingtutorial

import "testing"

func TestFullName(t *testing.T) {
 expectedFullName := "Andy Haskell"
 fullNameResult := FullName("Andy", "Haskell")

 if expectedFullName != fullNameResult {
 t.Errorf("Expected full name %s, got %s", expectedFullName, fullNameResult)
 }
}</code></pre>
<br>
<span><span><span><span><span><span>TestFullName</span></span>
is the test function we wrote for testing the <span><span>FullName</span></span>
function. The value <span><span>expectedFullName</span></span>
is what we want <span><span>FullName</span></span>
to return when we pass in my first and last name, and the value
<span><span>fullNameResult</span></span>
is what it actually returns. In the if statement below, if those
values are different, we consider the test to have failed by calling
<span><span>t.Errorf</span></span>,
and we log a message about the error in <span><span>Errorf</span></span>
using printf format. </span></span></span></span>
<span><span><span></span></span></span><br>

<p>
<span><span><span><span>What's
that weird <span><span>t</span></span>
though? <span><span>t</span></span>
is a <span><span>testing.T</span></span>,
and it's used for keeping track of a test and telling Go that your
function is a test. Any function in Go whose <b>name starts with </b><span><b><span>Test</span></b></span><b>
and takes in a </b><span><b><span>testing.T</span></b></span>
is <b>considered a test</b>, and the <span><span>testing.T</span></span>
lets you know whether the test passed or failed. (Similarly, Go knows
a file contains tests if it ends with <span><span>_test.go</span></span>).</span></span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span><span><span>The
rule for a Go test is if a <span><span>T</span></span>'s
<span><span>Errorf</span></span>,
<span><span>Fatalf</span></span>,
or <span><span>Fail</span></span>
function is called, the test failed. If not, the test passed.</span>&#xA0;</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span><span>So
let's see this test in action. In the command line, run <span><span>go
test</span></span> and you should get:</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<pre class="language-go"><span><span><code>--- FAIL: TestFullName (0.00s)
 fullname_test.go:11: Expected full name Andy Haskell, got AndyHaskell
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL github.com/AndyHaskell/testing-tutorial 0.004s</code></span></span></pre>
<span></span>
<br>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>A
failed test! But that's actually a good thing because that means our
test unearthed a bug. Here's a play-by-play of the test:</span></span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>

<span></span>
<br>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
<span><span>go
test</span></span> runs <span><span>TestFullName</span></span>.
We run <span><span>FullName</span></span>
on "Andy" and "Haskell", and get back
"AndyHaskell"</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
In the if statement, the value of <span><span>expectedFullName</span></span>
is "Andy Haskell" and the value of <span><span>fullNameResult</span></span>
is "AndyHaskell".</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>-
Since these two values are different, <span><span>t.Errorf</span></span>
is called, and the message &#x201C;Expected full name Andy Haskell, got
AndyHaskell&#x201D; is logged. Since <span><span>t.Errorf</span></span>
was called, the test failed.</span></span></span><br>
<span><span><br></span></span>
<span><span></span></span><br>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><b><span>Fixing
the bug</span></b></span></span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span><br>
<span>
</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>Now
that we found the bug, let's fix it. It's a pretty simple bug. All we
need to do is add in a space between <span><span>firstName</span></span>
and <span><span>lastName</span></span>
in <span><span>FullName</span></span>:</span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>
<span>
</span>
<pre class="language-go"><span><span><code class="language-go">func FullName(firstName, lastName string) string {
 return firstName + " " + lastName
}</code></span></span></pre>
<span>
</span><br>

<span>
</span>
<p>
<span>
<span><span><span>Now
with that bug fix, let's confirm that our test now works. Run <span><span>go
test</span></span> and you should get:</span></span></span></span></p>

<pre class="language-go"><span><code>PASS
ok github.com/AndyHaskell/testing-tutorial 0.004s</code></span></pre>





<p>
<span><span><span><span>A
passed test! Since we now got the result we expected for <span><span>fullName</span></span>,
<span><span>t.Errorf</span></span>
is never called, so the <span><span>TestFullName</span></span>
is considered to have passed!</span></span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<br>

<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>By
the way, while that was a simple bug, simple bugs like this happen
all the time in big software projects, and when the bug is simple and
the codebase is big, they're easy to miss. That's why it's smart to
write tests!</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<div class="separator">
<span><span><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pt1rzuZaa2o/VygMyB4DBEI/AAAAAAAAArg/ux9mtIGn1Q8bCLuvjbTS2LxplaRDJcr2QCLcB/s1600/lola%2Breaction.jpeg"><img border="0" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Pt1rzuZaa2o/VygMyB4DBEI/AAAAAAAAArg/ux9mtIGn1Q8bCLuvjbTS2LxplaRDJcr2QCLcB/s400/lola%2Breaction.jpeg" width="400"></a></span></span></div>
<p>
<span><span><span>&#xA0;When the bug you spent hours <span>fixing turned out</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>to be<span> a few keystrokes to f<span>ix</span></span> </span></span></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b><span><span>Multiple
assertions</span></span></b></p>
<b></b>


<div>
<span><span>The
if statement of that test:</span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">if expectedFullName != fullNameResult {
 t.Errorf("Expected full name %s, got %s", expectedFullName, fullNameResult)
}</code></span></pre>
<span></span><br>
<div>
<span><span><span>is
called an assertion, because it asserts what what we want our results
to be. The test we did had one assertion, but you can have more than
one in a test. Let's say we wanted to take a pair of latitude and
longitude coordinates in JSON (a format popular for communicating
data) into a Go struct. For example if we define the struct:</span></span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><code class="language-go">type Coordinate struct {
 Lat float64
 Lng float64
}</code></pre>
<span><span></span></span>
<div>



<p>
<span>then
the JSON <span>{"Lat: 42.</span><span>3</span><span>",
"Lng:-71.</span><span>1</span><span>"}</span>
would convert to <span><span>Coordinate{Lat:
42.</span></span><span><span>3</span></span><span><span>,
Lng: -71.</span></span><span><span>1</span></span><span><span>}</span></span></span></p>

<p>
<span>The
conversion function would look like this<span>:</span></span></p>
<pre class="language-go"><code class="language-go">package testingtutorial

import "encoding/json"

type Coordinate struct {
 Lat float64
 Lng float64
}

func ConvertCoordinates(coordJSON []byte) (*Coordinate, error) {
 var c Coordinate
 if err := json.Unmarshal(coordJSON, &amp;c); err != nil {
 return nil, err
 }
 return &amp;c, nil
}</code></pre>


<p>
<span><span><span>If
we were testing <span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>,
the things we'd need to test for are:</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
<span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
didn't error</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
<span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
gave us the correct latitude coordinate</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
<span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
gave us the correct longitude coordinate</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>-
If invalid JSON is passed into <span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>,
the function DOES error</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>That's
four assertions we'll want to make for the test. Here's what the test
will look like:</span></span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><span><code class="language-go">func TestConvertCoordinates(t *testing.T) {
 validCoordinateJSON := []byte(`{"Lat": 42.3, "Lng": -71.1}`)
 invalidCoordinateJSON := []byte(`{ThisIsInvalidJSON`)
 coords, err := ConvertCoordinates(validCoordinateJSON)
 if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Error unmarshalling valid coordinates: %v", err)
 }
 if coords.Lat != 42.3 {
 t.Errorf("Expected latitude 42.3, got %f", coords.Lat)
 }
 if coords.Lng != -71.1 {
 t.Errorf("Expected longitude -71.1, got %f", coords.Lng)
 }

 coords, err = ConvertCoordinates(invalidCoordinateJSON)
 if err == nil {
 t.Errorf("Unmarshal should have errored for invalid coordinates")
 }
}</code></span></span></pre>
<span><span></span></span><br>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>As
you can see, your test can have as many assertions as you need. The
first one asserts that there was no error calling <span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
on valid coordinates and the next two assertions make sure we got the
right coordinates. The last assertion asserts that <span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
returns an error for invalid coordinates. As your codebase for a
project gets bigger, your tests will get more complex as well, so
they will have a lot of assertions.</span></span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>

<span>
</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>By
the way, note that when we check if there was an error calling
<span>ConvertCoordinate</span><span>s</span>
on valid coordinates, rather than logging the error with <span><span>Errorf</span></span>
we use <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>.
These methods both cause a test to fail, but the difference is with
<span><span>Errorf</span></span>
the test <b>keeps going</b> through the other assertions while with
<span><span>Fatalf</span></span>
the test <b>stops altogether</b>.</span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>

<span>
</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>I
chose <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>
for that assertion because if <span><span>ConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
errors, we won't have a valid <span><span>Coordinate</span></span>
struct to test. My general rule is if your test has an assertion
where the rest of the test <b>depends on that assertion passing</b>,
use <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>
in the assertion. Otherwise, stick to <span><span>Errorf</span></span>
so if your assertion fails you can see how the rest of your test
goes.</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>Another
good example of a time to use <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>
is in a part of your test code that sets the stage for the test. If
you're testing code that works with a database, your test might begin
with setting up a mock database. If that fails, your test won't work
since you don't have a database so you'd do something like:</span><span></span></span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">mockDatabase, err := setupMockDatabase()
if err != nil {
 t.Fatalf("Error setting up mock database: %v", err)
}
// If we get past this if statement, run the rest of the test!</code></span></pre>
<span><span></span></span>
<p>

<span><span><span><span>to
stop the test if the database setup fails.</span></span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span><b><span>More
concise assertions with Testify</span></b></span></span></span></p>
<span></span>
<br>
<div>
<span></span>
<span><span><span>Overall
the basic Go testing package is very simple and flexible so you can
test your Go code using regular old Go code. However, as your number
of assertions go up, you can end up with a lot of bulky three-line if
statements that make your tests taller.</span><span></span></span></span>
<span><br></span>
<br>
<div>
<span><span>Luckily,
there's a series of packages called Testify in Go that let you write
one-line assertions with a readable syntax, and they work with the
<span><span>testing.T</span></span>
struct to be a natural extension of the testing package, rather than
a giant framework with a ton of new rules to learn. Instead of
writing an assertion like this:</span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">if coords.Lat != 42.3 {
 t.Errorf("Expected latitude 42.3, got %f", coords.Lat)
}</code></span></pre>
<br>
<p>
<span><span>You
can write it like this:</span></span></p>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">assert.Equal(t, 42.3, coords.Lat, "Expected latitude 42.3, got %f", coords.Lat)</code></span></pre>



<div>
<span><span><span>To
get Testify, run <span><span>go
get github.com/stretchr/testify/assert</span></span> and go get
<span><span>github.com/stretchr/testify/require</span></span>.
Testify Assert is a package for different kinds of testing
assertions. You can assert two values are equal with <span><span>assert.Equal</span></span>,
you can assert they are <span><span>NotEqual</span></span>,
you can assert that a value is <span><span>Nil</span></span>
or <span><span>NotNil</span></span>,
you can assert that a slice or map is a certain <span><span>Len</span></span>,
and there are tons more assertions you can check out in the <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/assert">godoc for Tesitfy Assert</a>!</span></span></span></div>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>Require
is almost identical to Assert but if a Require assertion fails, the
test stops like in <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>,
while the test keeps going on a fails Assert assertion. So now our
<span><span>TestConvertCoordinate</span></span><span><span>s</span></span>
function would now look like:</span></span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><span><code class="language-go">package testingtutorial

import (
 "testing"

 "github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
 "github.com/stretchr/testify/require"
)

func TestConvertCoordinatesTestify(t *testing.T) {
 validCoordinateJSON := []byte(`{"Lat": 42.3, "Lng": -71.1}`)
 invalidCoordinateJSON := []byte(`{ThisIsInvalidJSON`)

 coords, err := ConvertCoordinates(validCoordinateJSON)
 require.Nil(t, err, "Error unmarshalling valid coordinates: %v", err)
 assert.Equal(t, 42.3, coords.Lat, "Expected latitude 42.3, got %f", coords.Lat)
 assert.Equal(t, -71.1, coords.Lng, "Expected longitude -71.1, got %f", coords.Lng)

 coords, err = ConvertCoordinates(invalidCoordinateJSON)
 assert.NotNil(t, err, "Unmarshal should have errored for invalid coordinates")
}</code></span></span></pre>
<span><span><br></span></span></div>
<span></span></div>
<div>
<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>Now
we have a test that's much cleaner, shorter (19 lines vs. 13 lines),
and easier to read! And as I mentioned earlier, that's especially
important in Go testing where your automated tests double as
documentation.</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>Note
that our <span><span>Fatalf</span></span>
test to check that <span><span>ConvertCoordinates</span></span>
didn't error now checks for the error with <span><span>require.Nil</span></span>.
Meanwhile we use <span><span>assert.Equal</span></span>
to check that we got the right coordinates, and <span><span>assert.NotNil</span></span>
to check that we get an error if we call <span><span>ConvertCoordinates</span></span>
on invalid JSON. Technically all of those assertions could have used
<span><span>Equal</span></span>
or <span><span>NotE</span></span><span><span>qual</span></span>,
but Testify assert gives us flexibility in how we write our tests.</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>Another
convenient feature of Testify assertions is that if an assertion
fails, Testify gives us an error message showing the call stack that
led up to the assertion failure so we can track bugs more easily.</span></span></span></p>
<span></span>

<span></span>
<div>
<span><span><span>Let's
say we wanted to move both coordinate assertions to a helper
function:</span></span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><span><code class="language-go">func assertCoordinates(t *testing.T, lat, lng float64, coords *Coordinate) {
 assert.Equal(t, lat, coords.Lat, "Expected latitude %f, got %f",
 lat, coords.Lat)
 assert.Equal(t, lng, coords.Lng, "Expected longitude %f, got %f",
 lng, coords.Lng)
}</code></span></span></pre>
<span><span><br></span></span>
<span><span></span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>And
in the main test, we call these assertions (but expect the wrong
coordinates)</span><span>:</span></span></span></span></p>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">require.Nil(t, err, "Error unmarshalling valid coordinates: %v", err)
assertCoordinates(t, 39.7, -71.1, coords)</code></span></pre>


<div>
<span><span>We
would get the error:</span></span><br>
<pre class="language-go"><span><code class="language-go">--- FAIL: TestConvertCoordinatesWithHelper (0.00s)
 Error Trace: coords_testify_helper_test.go:11
 coords_testify_helper_test.go:21
 Error: Not equal: 39.7 (expected)
 != 42.3 (actual)
 Messages: Expected latitude 39.700000, got 42.300000</code></span></pre>
<span></span><br>
<p>
<span><span><span>This
tells us not only that the assertion failed in <span><span>assertCoordinates</span></span>,
but also that the call to <span><span>assertCoordinates</span></span>
was on line 21. As your tests get bigger and more complex, helper
functions are incredibly useful for keeping your tests easier to read
and keeping redundant code out of the way of the meat of the tests.
As we have just seen, this Testify assert call stack can be extremely
useful for tracking assertion failures that happen inside a helper
function!</span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>

<span>
</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>So
now we've seen the basics of how to write Go tests with the built-in
Go testing package and Testify Assert and Require. While it's pretty
simple, these testing tools are incredibly flexible for writing
tests. Since all your test code is just regular Go code, you can make
your tests as simple or complex as they need to be.</span></span></span></p>
<span>
</span>

<span></span>
<p>
<span><span><span>In
my next testing tutorial, I will be showing techniques on how to keep
your tests well-managed as your project evolves and you have more
code to test. For homework, if you have some Go code you've written,
try writing some tests with the testing, assert, and require
packages.</span></span></span></p>
