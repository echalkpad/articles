 <p>Vue makes it incredibly easy to add transitions to your application. The
transitions I'm talking about here are those that run when elements are inserted
into or removed from the DOM.</p>
<p>An example of this would be showing/hiding a modal box that contains something
to display to the user. We've seen a whole example on how to build one of those
in <a href="http://taha-sh.com/blog/how-to-create-a-reusable-modal-box-in-laravel-vuejs">the previous
tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, I'm going to show you how you can use transitions in your
application in a few seconds!</p>
<h2>What options do we have?</h2>
<p>Vue gives us two options to add transitions to elements. One with CSS and the
other with JavaScript.</p>
<p>Both are fine. But since the CSS approach is the most used one, and because with
it, we can use some external animation libraries (such as
<a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a>), it's going to be our
choice in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Which elements are going to animate?</h2>
<p>The way you tell an element to animate is by using the attribute <em>"transition"</em>
on it. But in order for that to work, that element must have one of the
following attributes: <em>v-if</em>, <em>v-show</em>, or <em>v-for</em>.</p>
<p>It should be obvious why we need them. Those are the basic ways to show and hide
elements, duh!</p>
<p>So an example of such an element would be:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;div v-if="ok" transition="foo"&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><em>"foo"</em> is the name of the transition you want to run (you name it as you want).</p>
<h2>The manual way</h2>
<p>After you specify the name of the transition (in this case <em>foo</em>), you'll get
three CSS rules to define.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>.foo-transition</strong>: This is the normal state for the element.</li>
<li><strong>.foo-enter</strong>: This is the starting state (before it's shown).</li>
<li><strong>.foo-leave</strong>: This is ending state (when the element is leaving).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example (from the <a href="http://vuejs.org/guide/transitions.html#Example">official documentation of
VueJS</a>) of how you'd define
them.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">.foo-transition <span>{</span>
 transition: all .3s ease;
 height: 30px;
 padding: 10px;
 background-color: #eee;
 overflow: hidden;
}

.foo-enter, .foo-leave <span>{</span>
 height: 0;
 padding: 0 10px;
 opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So here's what happens. When the element is about to be shown, the <em>foo-enter</em>
class will be applied on the element. After that, when it's fully shown, the
class will change to <em>foo-transition</em>. Finally, when the element is leaving, the
class will be <em>foo-leaving</em>.</p>
<p>Now that's great! But this is the manual way of doing it. What instead you can
do, is use already defined classes from some CSS animation library (like
<a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a>).</p>
<h2>Animating with animate.css</h2>
<p><a href="https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/">Animate.css</a> provides a huge list of
nice CSS transitioning effects that you can choose from. But the problem,
though, their classes' names don't follow the convention of the Vue transition
system (<em>.foo-transition</em>, <em>.foo-enter</em>, <em>.foo-leave</em>).</p>
<p>However, in version <em>1.0.14</em>, Vue gives us a way to change those class names to
anything we want.</p>
<p>Here's how we can do it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">Vue.transition('foo', <span>{</span>
 enterClass: 'bounceInLeft',
 leaveClass: 'bounceOutRight'
})
</code></pre>
<p>So we provide it with the class names that we want to use for both states
(entering &amp; leaving). These class names can be anything we want, but in most
cases, we'll get them from some CSS animation library, like Animate.css in this
case.</p>
<p>All of this means, <em>bounceInLeft</em> &amp; <em>bounceOutRight</em> will be our new transition
classes instead of <em>foo-enter</em> &amp; <em>foo-leave</em>, respectively.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>To finish up this tutorial, I'd like to leave you with a quick demo that uses
what we've learned in this tutorial.</p>
