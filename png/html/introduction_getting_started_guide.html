<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The OpenDaylight project is an open source platform for Software Defined Networking (SDN) that uses open protocols to provide centralized, programmatic control and network device monitoring. Like many other SDN controllers, OpenDaylight supports OpenFlow, as well as offering ready-to-install network solutions as part of its platform.</p>
<p>Much as your operating system provides an interface for the devices that comprise your computer, OpenDaylight provides an interface that allows you to connect network devices quickly and intelligently for optimal network performance.</p>
<p>It&#x2019;s extremely helpful to understand that setting up your networking environment with OpenDaylight is not a single software installation. While your first chronological step is to install OpenDaylight, you also install additional functionality packaged as Karaf features to suit your specific needs.</p>
<p>Before walking you through the initial OpenDaylight installation, this guide presents a fuller picture of OpenDaylight&#x2019;s framework and functionality so you understand how to set up your networking environment. This guide walks you through the necessary steps.</p>
<h3>What&#x2019;s different about OpenDaylight</h3>
<p>Major distinctions of OpenDaylight&#x2019;s SDN compared to traditional SDN options are the following:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices">microservices</a>&#xA0;architecture, in which a &#x201C;microservice&#x201D; is a particular protocol or service that a user wants to enable within their installation of the OpenDaylight controller, for example:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>A plugin that provides connectivity to devices via the OpenFlow or BGP protocols</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An L2-Switch or a service such as Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA).</p>
<p>					Note: A thorough understanding of the microservices architecture is important for experienced network developers who want to create new solutions in OpenDaylight. If you are new to networking and OpenDaylight, you most likely won&#x2019;t design solutions, but you should comprehend the microservices concept to understand how OpenDaylight works and how it differs from other SDN programs.</p>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<p>Support for a wide and growing range of network protocols beyond OpenFlow, including SNMP, NETCONF, OVSDB, BGP, PCEP, LISP, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support for developing new functionality comprised of additional networking protocols and services.</p>
</li>
</ul><h3>What you&#x2019;ll find in this guide</h3>
<p>To set up your environment, you first install OpenDaylight followed by the Apache Karaf features that offer the functionality you require. The OpenDaylight Getting Started Guide covers installation procedures, feature descriptions and their individual installation commands.</p>
<p>The Getting Started Guide also includes other helpful information, with the following organization:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>An overview of OpenDaylight and common use models&#xA0;(current page)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who should use this guide?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenDaylight concepts and tools</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explanations of OpenDaylight Apache Karaf features that extend network functionality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenDaylight Beryllium system requirements and Release Notes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OpenDaylight installation instructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Feature table with installation names and compatibility notes</p>
</li>
</ol><h3><a id="who">Who should use this guide?</a></h3>
<p>OpenDaylight is for users considering open options in network programming. This guide provides information for the following types of users:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Those new to OpenDaylight who want to install it and select the features they need to run their network environment using only the command line and GUI. Such users include:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>Students</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network administrators and engineers.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<p>Network engineers and network application developers who want to use OpenDaylight&#x2019;s REST APIs to manage their network programmatically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network engineers and network application developers who want to write their own OpenDaylight services and plugins for greater functionality. This group of users needs a significant level of expertise in the following areas, which is beyond the scope of this document:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>The YANG modeling language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Model-Driven Service Abstraction Layer (MD-SAL)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maven build tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of the shared data store</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to handle notifications and/or Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs)</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><p>Developers who would like to join the OpenDaylight community and contribute code upstream. People in this group design offerings such as applications/services, protocol implementations, and so on, to increase OpenDaylight functionality for the benefit of all end-users.</p>
<p>	Note: If you develop code to build new functionality for OpenDaylight and push it upstream (not required), it can become part of the OpenDaylight release. Users can then install the features to implement the solution you&#x2019;ve created.</p>
