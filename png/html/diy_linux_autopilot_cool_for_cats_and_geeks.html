<p>I want to share with you the tremendous fun I'm having with the BBBmini DIY ArduPilot project, which I discovered during the summer. Hopefully, I can demonstrate what a sexy DIY Linux Autopilot for around 100 bucks looks like and convince you why Linux autopilots are cooler than a cat playing the piano. <br> &#xA0;<br> For some background,&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/profile/MirkoDenecke" target="_self">Mirko Denecke</a>, who designed the BBBmini, wrote an introductory blog post on his DIY ArduPilot Cape&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/bbbmini-as-linux-autopilot-based-on-ardupilot-and-beaglebone" target="_self">here</a>, and about further enhancements <a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/bbbmini-enhancement" target="_self">here</a>.<br> &#xA0;<br> Since Mirko released rev1.4 into the wild as&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/bbbmini-is-now-open-hardware" target="_self">Open Hardware</a>, there's been a&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/group/bbbmini" target="_self">BBBmini usergroup</a> down at DIY Drones, so that's a good place to see what's happening with the technology. <br> &#xA0;<br> Rekindled enthusiasm <br> &#xA0;<br> Being a Linux autopilot enthusiast, I naturally had a BeagleBone Black lying around and so was immediately attracted to this project. While building and getting the BBBmini into the air, I quickly realized that it was just the right kind of project I needed to rekindle my enthusiasm. <br> &#xA0;<br> DIY Linux autopilots: What's the attraction? <br> &#xA0;<br> I really love the idea of flying Linux autopilots and must admit I've been hooked since I saw the first talks Andrew Tridgell and others gave on the topic, the early rumors about PXF, and the first boards like NavIO and&#xA0; Erlebrain and so forth. I can see a bright future in this field, with the kind of&#xA0; collaborative community effort such as that down at DIY Drones - which drives the technology forward. <br> &#xA0;<br> After finally joining the Linux autopilot club, I had a kind of epiphany about how it opens a huge door to the opportunity of getting new ideas integrated much more easily thanks to the power of open innovation. The underlying Linux offers a sense of comfort and massive gains in usability. <br> &#xA0;<br> Getting more out of your Autopilot <br> &#xA0;<br> For example, I recently decided to configure my quad to log into different folders each day and rsync my log files to my NAS running samba at startup. That way I can archive them for later use as well and delete old logs when the SD cards becomes full. So, I should be find logs more easily and create a permanent archive, which was the initial reason for the set-up. This was all done with a few very basic modifications and open source tools / software made available by developers for public use. <br> &#xA0;<br> Build your own DIY Linux autopilot <br> &#xA0;<br> So, if you too like getting hands-on and want to make your own DIY Linux autopilot, now is the time to get your feet wet. <br> &#xA0;<br> We're all keen to see what you'll come up with. For example, Mirko did a&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ow5aKap_sI" target="_blank">self-balancing robot based on the BBBmini and ArduPilot</a> software, and I have something in the pipeline to fill the long winter nights. <br> &#xA0;<br> We are working on improving the BBBmini experience and since Mirko recently added dual-MPU9250 support we are now flying with two MPU9250's. We also have a few ideas for extra add-ons. <br> &#xA0;<br> I have put together a&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bbbmini.com/" target="_blank">BBBmini DIY Kit</a> to simplify the process of getting started, and if you are interested in buying a kit or just a&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI-PCB" target="_blank">PCB</a> please&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://diydrones.com/profiles/message/newFromProfile?screenName=3s26xa3rqtqfg&amp;target=http%3A%2F%2Fdiydrones.com" target="_self">send me a PM</a> or go&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="http://bbbmini.com/buy-bbbmini/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br> &#xA0;<br> Here is a short video of me flying the bbbmini just for fun. <br> &#xA0;<br> <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SnPXBse6fVU?feature=player_detailpage&amp;wmode=opaque"></iframe> 
<br> &#xA0;<br> The full project is available on&#xA0;<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mirkix/BBBMINI" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and we invite interested users to contribute to the further development of the project. <br> &#xA0;<br> Happy flying. <br> &#xA0;<br> Cheers, <br> Linus <br> &#xA0;</p> </div>
