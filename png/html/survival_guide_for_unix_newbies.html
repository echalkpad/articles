<h2>What is computing with Unix?</h2>


<p>
Unix is a family of operating systems and 
environments
that exploits the power of linguistic 
abstraction and composition
to orchestrate tasks.
</p>

<p>
Unix users spend a lot of time at the command line.
</p>

<p>
The command line (often called the console, the shell or the terminal)
looks something like this:
</p>




<p>
When you type in a command like <code>ls</code>, it will
give you feedback:
</p>

<div>
<pre>

 $ ls
 <span>Documents</span> README.txt

 $ _

</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this case, the <code>ls</code> command listed 
the files in the current directory.
</p>





<h2>Getting access to Unix</h2>

<p> It
was once a 
daunting task to 
get access to or install Unix.

Fortunately, it's 
no longer a hassle. </p>


<p> These days, the two most accessible flavors of Unix are Apple's OS X (based
on the BSD family of Unix) and Ubuntu Linux. </p>



<h3>The easy option: OS X</h3>

<p>
OS X is a good way for many users to tip-toe into Unix.
</p>

<p> 
What you're buying is a Unix machine 
that "just works."
</p>

<p> To turn it into a complete Unix system, you'll need to install Apple's free
Xcode development suite (available from the Mac App Store)
and the (free) X11 server.</p>

<p> Xcode includes the compilers and interpreters you'll need to compile and
run many open source applications. </p>

<p>
You'll need the X11 server to run traditional graphical applications
for Unix.
</p>



<h3>The DIY option: Linux</h3>

<p> When I was in high school, before CD burning was widely available
and when internet connections were slow, the best way to get Linux was
to buy a book with an installation CD. </p>

<p>
(Given that there wasn't much in the way of online resources
for Linux back then, 
 it was good to have a book that walked through the
 installation process and explained all the features, too.)
</p>


<p>
A 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26x%3D0%26ref_%3Dnb_sb_noss%26y%3D0%26field-keywords%3Dlinux%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dstripbooks&amp;tag=ucmbread-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957">quick search of amazon</a>

shows no shortages of such books today.
</p>


<p>
These days, there are plenty of free options:
</p>

<ul>


<li>
If you're a CS major, you should have access to a Unix shell account at your
school that you can acces with <code>ssh</code>. (See <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/#ssh">details on ssh</a> below.) 
</li>


<li>
You can set up your computer to dual boot into either your preferred OS or Linux.
Macs come with 

<a href="http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/">Boot Camp</a>

to make this easy.

If you take the dual boot route with a Windows PC, FIRST BACK UP YOUR DATA.

There is a chance you'll wipe out your files by accident.

I recommend adding a second internal hard drive if you want to set up a dual
boot with Linux for the first time. </li>



<li>
You can burn a CD that lets you boot into or install Linux.
I recommend <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> for this.
</li>


<li>
You can also create a USB thumb drive that boots into Linux.
I recommend <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> for this as well.
</li>


<li>
You can run Linux inside your existing OS as a virtual machine.
<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> is a freely available virtualization tool.

(I personally use 

<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q72JB8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ucmbread-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002Q72JB8">VMware Fusion</a>

to run Windows on my Mac for those rare
instances where I need to see what a page looks like in an old version of IE.)
</li>

<li> You can run <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> on Windows to get
a "Unix-like" environment. (This isn't quite the real deal.)</li>


<li>
You can buy a virtualized Linux server with remote access from a 
service like 

<a href="http://www.linode.com/?r=bf5d4e7c8a1af61855b5227279a6744c3bde8a8a">linode.com</a>.

(might.net runs on a linode.)
</li>


</ul>



<h2>Getting to the command line</h2>

<p>
Once you're into Unix, you'll want to get to the command line.
</p>

<p> On Linux, you can press CTRL+ALT+F1 to get to a raw terminal, and
CTRL+ALT+F7 to get back to the window system. 

(In fact, CTRL+ALT+F1-F6 will get you different terminal on most systems, and
of course, you can configure this.) </p>


<p> 
In most popular flavors of Linux, there is a way
to open a graphical terminal in a window.
</p>

<p>
On a Mac, it's Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Terminal.
</p>




<h2>The filesystem: <code>ls</code> and <code>cd</code></h2>

<p>
If you find yourself at a command prompt, run <code>ls</code>
to list the files in the current directory.
</p>

<p>
You might see something like this:
</p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ ls
 <span>Documents</span> README.txt

 $ _

</pre>
</div>



<p>
With <code>ls /</code>, you can list the contents of the 
root directory.
</p>

<p>
You'll notice several 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard#Directory_structure">directories that are common to almost all Unices</a>:
</p>

<ul>

 <li><code>/bin</code>, standard executables.</li>
 <li><code>/sbin</code>, important system executables.</li>
 <li><code>/etc</code>, system configuration files.</li>
 <li><code>/var</code>, frequently updated files like logs.</li>
 <li><code>/root</code>, home directory of the administrator account. </li>
 <li><code>/home</code>, a user account home directories. 
 (<code>/Users</code> on a Mac.)</li>
 <li><code>/opt</code>, package-manager installed files.</li>
 <li><code>/tmp</code>, temporary files; usually wiped between boots.</li>
 <li><code>/usr</code>, user applications and utilities.</li>



</ul>


<p>
To change to a different directory, use the command <code>cd</code>.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>cd Documents</code> to change to the <code>Documents</code> sub-folder.</li>
 <li><code>cd ..</code> to change to the parent directory.</li>
 <li><code>cd</code> to change to your home directory.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Paths</h3>

<p>
To print the path of the current working directory, use <code>pwd</code>:
</p>





<p>
On Unix, a path is a description of a file's location.
</p>

<p> For example, <code>/home/matt/README</code> is a path to a file called
<code>README</code> contained within the home directory for the user
<code>matt</code>. </p>

<p>
Notice that forward slashes (<code>/</code>) separate components
of a path.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ pwd
 /home/matt
 $ cd ..
 $ pwd
 /home
 $ cd matt
 $ pwd
 /home/matt
 $ _

</pre>
</div>



<h3>Symbolic links</h3>

<p>
Unix filesystems make use of aliases for files known as symbolic links
(symlinks).
</p>

<p>
(There are also <em>hard</em> links, 
in which there are two true, indistingushible
references to the same file, but these are less commonly used.)
</p>

<p>
A symbolic link to a file is ordinarily treated identically
to that file.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>ln -s</code> creates sym links.
</p>

<p>
The command <code>ls -l</code> can reveal where a symlink points.
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<div>
<pre>

 $ ls
 bar foo

 $ ln -s bar baz

 $ ls -l
 total 8
 -rw-r--r-- 1 matt staff 0 Jan 8 09:57 bar
 lrwxr-xr-x 1 matt staff 3 Jan 8 09:58 baz -&gt; bar
 -rw-r--r-- 1 matt staff 0 Jan 8 09:57 foo

 $ _

</pre>
</div>





<h2>Working with text: <code>cat</code>, <code>less</code>, <code>emacs</code>
and <code>vi</code></h2>


<p>
Suppose you want to look at a text file within the current
directory.
</p>

<p>
A common way to take a glance at a text file is with the
<code>cat</code> command:
</p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ cat README.txt
 articles _articles bin CAs devops Documents dotfiles gethtml go hnews jason js netdata start-thesrc thesrc ucii A README file for my home directory.
 
 Documents contains my files.

 $ _

</pre>
</div>


<p>
(The command <code>cat</code> is actually meant to do more
powerful things than just look at files, but that's what
it's most commonly used for.)
</p>

<p>
If the file is too long to fit on a screen, use <code>less</code>
instead of <code>cat</code>. (To quit <code>less</code>, 
press <code>q</code>.)
</p>

<p>
You're going to spend a lot of time editing text, so you'll want 
to learn one (or both) of the powerful Unix text editors: 
<code>emacs</code> and <code>vim</code>.
</p>

<p>
Both have a tutorial mode for teaching the essentials.
</p>



<h2>Help yourself: <code>man</code> up</h2>

<p>
If you don't know what a command does, 
use the command <code>man <i>command</i></code>.
</p>

<p>
This will bring up the man(ual) page for <i>command</i>,
which will document how the command operates;
it frequently provides examples of usage.
</p>

<p>
Press <code>q</code> to quit the man page viewer.
</p>

<p>
The <code>apropos</code> can help you find the command you're looking for
if you don't know it's name.

It will search a database of command <em>descriptions</em>.
</p>

<p>
Some tools use an alternate documentation 
system called <code>info</code>
</p>

<p>
To look up documentation using <code>info</code>,
try <code>info <i>topic</i></code>.
</p>

<p>
For more info on <code>info</code>, run <code>info info</code>.
</p>



<h2>Search for it: <code>grep</code> and <code>find</code></h2>

<p> If you're looking for text within a file or a set of files,
<code>grep</code> is the right tool. </p>

<p>
The command <code>grep <i>pattern</i> <i>file ...</i></code>
will search the specified files for the pattern.
</p><p> The pattern language used throughout Unix is called <i>regular
expressions</i>, and there are many good introductions to these, including the
man page for grep. </p>

<p> To list all files under the working directory (and its subdirectories), try
the command <code>find</code>.</p>




<h2>Pipes and redirection</h2>

<p> Nearly every command in Unix makes use of a convention to have a "standard
input" (also called stdin or STDIN) and standard output (also called stdout or
STDOUT).
</p>

<p> There is also a "standard error" (stderr or STDERR) output that is, by
convention, reserved for error messages. </p>

<p>
Many techniques in Unix rely on redirecting these channels.
</p>

<p>
If you want to dump the standard output into a file, use 
<code><i>command</i> &gt; <i>file</i></code>.
</p><p>
For example:
</p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ pwd &gt; pwd.txt 
 $ ls
 pwd.txt
 $ cat pwd.txt
 /home/matt
 $ _

</pre>
</div>


<p>
One of the most useful capabilities of Unix is 
the ability to redirect the STDOUT of one command
into the STDIN of another.
</p>

<p>
To do this, you'll want to use a "pipe"; for example:
</p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ find . | grep READ
 ./Desktop/READINGLIST.txt
 ./README.txt
 $ _

</pre>
</div>


<p>
This command found a file named 
<code>READINGLIST.txt</code> in the <code>Desktop</code>
subdirectory, and a file named <code>README</code>
in the current one.
</p>

<p>
It's customary for Unix programs to read from STDIN when no input
file is specified, which is what <code>grep</code> is doing here.
</p>


<p>
It is also possible to send the contents of a file into
the STDIN of a command using <code><i>command</i> &lt; <i>file</i></code>.
</p>





<h2>Permissions: <code>chmod</code>, <code>chown</code> and <code>chgrp</code></h2>

<p>
In Unix, every file and directory has an owner and a group.
</p>

<p>
Every user on a Unix machine can belong to one or more groups.
</p>

<p> Every file also has three sets of permissions: what the owner can do, what
the group can do and what anyone can do. </p>

<p> To see the owner, group and permissions associated with a file run <code>ls
-l</code>. You'll see something like: </p>


<div>
<pre>

 $ ls -l
 drwxr-xr-x 4 matt staff 136 Jun 23 2010 Documents
 drwxr-xr-x 143 matt staff 4862 Dec 30 2009 Desktop
 -rw-r--r-- 1 matt staff 4 Feb 7 11:16 README.txt 
 $ _

</pre>
</div>



<p>
The first column tells you about the permissions on the file.
</p>

<p>
The third and fourth tell you the owner and group respectively.
</p>

<p>
The very first character in the permissions column tells you what kind of file it is.
A <code>-</code> means it's a regular file. A <code>d</code> means it's a directory.
</p>

<p>
The next nine characters come in three classes of three characters each.
The three classes are owner permissions, group permissions and world permissions.
</p>

<p>
Inside a permission class, 
<code>r</code> means that class can read the file;
<code>w</code> means that class can write the file;
<code>x</code> means that class can execute the file.
</p>

<p> If a file is a directory, <code>x</code> grants the permission to access
inside the directory, while <code>r</code> grants permission to list its
contents.
</p>




<h2>Package managers</h2>

<p>
Modern Unixes have package managers to that download install
(free) software for you.
</p>

<p> On a Mac, <a href="http://www.macports.com/">MacPorts</a> is a popular
package-management system,
and <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Homebrew</a>
is gaining in popularity.
</p>

<p>
On Ubuntu, <code>apt</code> is the standard package manager, with
both a command-line and graphical interface available.
</p>


<p> It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with your package manager. </p>



<a name="ssh"></a>
<h2>Remote access: <code>ssh</code></h2>

<p> If you have more than one machine, or you need remote access to another
machine, <code>ssh</code> is a powerful "secure shell" utility. </p>

<p>
<code>ssh</code> can grant you console access on a remote machine, while safely
encrypting the session.
</p>

<p>
It is worth setting up passwordless key-based authentication
using <code><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ssh-keygen">ssh-keygen</a></code>.
</p>

<p>
Using <code>~/.ssh/config</code>, many options, including aliases
and per-host private keys, are available. (Try <code>man ssh_config</code>).
</p>

<p>
To ssh into another computer, use <code>ssh <i>user</i>@<i>address</i></code>
where <i>user</i> is the user name of your account on the other machine,
and <i>address</i> is host name or IP address of the other computer.
</p>

<p>
Windows users can use 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>
to connect to another computer over ssh.
</p>
