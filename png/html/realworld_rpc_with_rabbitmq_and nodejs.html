<p>I&#x2019;m currently working on a platform that relies heavily on RPC over RabbitMQ to move incoming requests through a chain&#xA0;of Node.JS worker processes. The high level setup for RPC is well described in RabbitMQ&#x2019;s documentation; let&#x2019;s steal their diagram:</p>
<p><img class=" size-full wp-image-831 aligncenter" src="https://facundoolano.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/python-six.png?w=594" alt="python-six"></p>
<p>We grew our RPC client code based on the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-javascript.html" target="_blank">JavaScript tutorial</a>, using the <a href="https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node" target="_blank">amqp.node</a>&#xA0;module. The first &#x2014;admittedly naive&#x2014; implementation just created a new connection, channel and queue per request and killed the connection after getting a reply:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const sendRPCMessage = (settings, message, rpcQueue) =&gt;
 amqp.connect(settings.url, settings.socketOptions)
 .then((conn) =&gt; conn.createChannel())
 .then((channel) =&gt; channel.assertQueue('', settings.queueOptions)
 .then((replyQueue) =&gt; new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
 const correlationId = uuid.v4();
 const msgProperties = {
 correlationId,
 replyTo: replyQueue.queue
 };

 function consumeAndReply (msg) {
 if (!msg) return reject(Error.create('consumer cancelled by rabbitmq'));

 if (msg.properties.correlationId === correlationId) {
 resolve(msg.content);
 }
 }

 channel.consume(replyQueue.queue, consumeAndReply, {noAck: true})
 .then(() =&gt; channel.sendToQueue(rpcQueue, new Buffer(message), msgProperties));
 })));
</pre>
<p>That got us a long way during development but obviously failed to perform under non-trivial loads. What was more shocking is that it got dramatically worse when running it on a RabbitMQ cluster.</p>
<p>So we needed to refactor our client code. The problem is that <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-six-javascript.html">most</a>&#xA0;<a href="https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node/blob/master/examples/tutorials/rpc_client.js">examples</a> show how to send one-off RPC messages, but aren&#x2019;t that clear on how the approach would be used at scale on a long-lived process. We obviously needed to reuse the connection but how about the channel? Should I create a new callback queue per incoming request or a single one per client?</p>
<h3>Using a single reply-to queue per client</h3>
<p>Based on the tutorial, I&#xA0;understood that the sensible approach was to reuse the queue from which the client consumed the RPC replies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the method presented above we suggest creating a callback queue for every RPC request. That&#x2019;s pretty inefficient, but fortunately there is a better way &#x2013; let&#x2019;s create a single callback queue per client. That raises a new issue, having received a response in that queue it&#x2019;s not clear to which request the response belongs. That&#x2019;s when the correlation_id property is used.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were already checking&#xA0;the <code>correlationId</code>, and just needed to create the reply-to queue in advance:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const createClient = (settings) =&gt;
 amqp.connect(settings.url, settings.socketOptions)
 .then((conn) =&gt; conn.createChannel())
 .then((channel) =&gt; channel.assertQueue('', settings.queueOptions)
 .then((replyQueue) =&gt; {
 channel.replyQueue = replyQueue.queue;
 return channel;
 }));
</pre>
<p>I&#xA0;thought that would be&#xA0;enough to make sure the right consumer got the right message, but in practice I&#xA0;found that each message was always delivered to the first consumer. Therefore, I&#xA0;needed to cancel the consumer after the reply was processed:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const sendRPCMessage = (channel, message, rpcQueue) =&gt;
 new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
 const correlationId = uuid.v4();
 const msgProperties = {
 correlationId,
 replyTo: channel.replyQueue
 };

 function consumeAndReply (msg) {
 if (!msg) return reject(Error.create('consumer cancelled by rabbitmq'));

 if (msg.properties.correlationId === correlationId) {
 channel.cancel(correlationId)
 .then(() =&gt; resolve(resolve(msg.content)));
 }
 }

 channel.consume(channel.replyQueue, consumeAndReply, {
 noAck: true,
 // use the correlationId as a consumerTag to cancel the consumer later
 consumerTag: correlationId
 })
 .then(() =&gt; channel.sendToQueue(rpcQueue, new Buffer(message), msgProperties));
 });
</pre>
<p>Enough? Only if the client processed one request at a time. As soon as I&#xA0;added some concurrency I&#xA0;saw that some of the messages were not handled at all. They were picked up by the wrong consumer, which ignored them because of the <code>correlationId</code> check,&#xA0;so&#xA0;they were&#xA0;lost. I&#xA0;needed to do something about unexpected message handling.</p>
<h3>Requeuing unexpected messages</h3>
<p>I&#xA0;tried using <code>nack</code> when a consumer received a reply to a message with an unexpected <code>correlationId</code>:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
function consumeAndReply (msg) {
 if (!msg) return reject(Error.create('consumer cancelled by rabbitmq'));

 if (msg.properties.correlationId === correlationId) {
 channel.ack(msg);
 channel.cancel(correlationId)
 .then(() =&gt; resolve(resolve(msg.content)));
 } else {
 channel.nack(msg);
 }
}
</pre>
<p>Now the messages seemed to be handled, eventually. Only they weren&#x2019;t: when I&#xA0;increased the load I&#xA0;saw message loss again. Further inspection revealed that the consumers were entering a weird infinite loop:</p>
<pre>Consumer A gets message B; message B requeued
Consumer B gets message C; Message C requeued
Consumer C gets message A; Message A requeued</pre>
<p>Repeated ad-infinitum. The same behaviour was reproduced using every possible combination of <code>nack</code>, <code>reject</code> and <code>sendToQueue</code> to send back&#xA0;the message.</p>
<p><a href="http://rabbitmq.1065348.n5.nabble.com/Push-to-back-of-Queue-on-NAck-td28421.html">Googling the issue</a>, I&#xA0;read about the possibility of using <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/dlx.html">Dead letter exchanges</a> to handle those cases. But having to manually requeue unexpected messages felt weird enough; introducing a new exchange and queue sounded like a lot of effort to handle what should be a pretty standard use case for RPC. Better to take a step back.</p>
<h3>Using a new reply-to queue per request</h3>
<p>So I&#xA0;went back to a reply-to queue per request. This was marginally better than our initial approach since now at least we were recycling the connection and the channel. What&#x2019;s more, that appeared to be the standard way to do RPC in RabbitMQ according to the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31705146/993769" target="_blank">few</a> <a href="https://github.com/rudijs/amqp.node-rpc-factory">spots</a> where I&#xA0;found non-tutorial implementation details, so, as Paul Graham would say, we wouldn&#x2019;t get in trouble for using it.</p>
<p>And it worked well for us as long as we run a single RabbitMQ instance. When we moved to a RabbitMQ cluster the performance was pretty much the same as when we were creating connections like there was no tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Using direct reply-to</h3>
<p>We were seriously considering dropping the RabbitMQ cluster altogether (which meant turning our broker into a single point of failure), when I came across the link to the <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/direct-reply-to.html">direct reply-to documentation</a>. The first interesting thing there was that it confirmed why we were seeing such bad performance when running a RabbitMQ cluster:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client can declare a single-use queue for each request-response pair. But this is inefficient; even a transient unmirrored queue can be expensive to create and then delete (compared with the cost of sending a message). This is especially true in a cluster as all cluster nodes need to agree that the queue has been created, even if it is unmirrored.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Direct reply-to uses a pseudo-queue instead, avoiding the queue declaration cost. And fortunately it was fairly straightforward to implement:</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">
const createClient = (settings) =&gt; amqp.connect(settings.url, settings.socketOptions)

const sendRPCMessage = (client, message, rpcQueue) =&gt; conn.createChannel()
 .then((channel) =&gt; new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
 const replyToQueue = 'amq.rabbitmq.reply-to';
 const timeout = setTimeout(() =&gt; channel.close(), 10000);

 const correlationId = uuid.v4();
 const msgProperties = {
 correlationId,
 replyTo: replyToQueue
 };

 function consumeAndReply (msg) {
 if (!msg) return reject(Error.create('consumer cancelled by rabbitmq'));

 if (msg.properties.correlationId === correlationId) {
 resolve(msg.content);
 clearTimeout(timeout);
 channel.close();
 }
 }

 channel.consume(replyToQueue, consumeAndReply, {noAck: true})
 .then(() =&gt; channel.sendToQueue(rpcQueue, new Buffer(content), msgProperties))
 });
</pre>
<p>This worked just as we expected, even in the cluster. As the code shows, we still create a new channel per request and we need to handle its closing, even if the response never comes. Reusing a single channel per client didn&#x2019;t seem to <a href="https://github.com/squaremo/amqp.node/issues/259">play along well</a> with direct reply-to, but so far we haven&#x2019;t&#xA0;found this to be an issue.</p>
