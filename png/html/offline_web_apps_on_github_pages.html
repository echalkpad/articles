 <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API/Using_Service_Workers" target="_blank">Service Workers</a> are a response to the <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/application-cache-is-a-douchebag" target="_blank">problems of Application Cache</a>, and they&#x2019;re a powerful and elegant way to offline your web app. But they&#x2019;re also more complex to implement and maintain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> is a great, simple static host for <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/" target="_blank">offline-first apps</a>. But deploying apps to GitHub Pages requires manual configuration, especially if you develop with a team, utilize some variant of the <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/" target="_blank">GitHub Flow</a>, and want to set up continuous deployment.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mozilla/oghliner" target="_blank">Oghliner</a> is an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a> package that simplifies both offlining an app with Service Workers and deploying the app to GitHub Pages (including continuous deployment using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>). Oghliner&#x2019;s goal is to make it as simple as possible to offline and deploy a web app.</p>

<p>To start using Oghliner, install it globally:</p>
<pre>&gt; npm install --global oghliner
</pre>
<p>If you have an existing app in a GitHub repository, invoke the <strong>integrate</strong> command to configure it. That command copies an offline-manager.js script (which registers the service worker) into your app and reminds you to load that script in your app&#x2019;s page(s)/template(s) (one of the few steps that Oghliner doesn&#x2019;t yet automate).</p>
<pre>&gt; oghliner integrate
Integrating Oghliner into the app in the current directory&#x2026;

<span>&#x2713;</span> Copying offline-manager.js to ./&#x2026; done!

Oghliner has been integrated into the app!

The app needs to load the script offline-manager.js in order to register
the service worker that offlines the app. To load the script, add this line to 
the app's HTML page(s)/template(s):

<span>&lt;script src="offline-manager.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>

And commit the changes and push the commit to the origin/master branch:

<span>git commit -m"integrate Oghliner" --all
git push origin master</span>

Then you can offline and deploy the app using the offline and deploy commands.

<span>&#x2139; For more information about offlining and deployment, see:
&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; https://mozilla.github.io/oghliner/</span>
</pre>
<p>If you don&#x2019;t yet have an existing app, start a new app by <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">creating a new repository</a> on GitHub, cloning it to your local machine, and invoking the <strong>bootstrap</strong> command from its working directory.</p>
<pre>&gt; git clone git@github.com:mykmelez/offline-app.git
Cloning into 'offline-app'...
&#x2026;
&gt; cd offline-app/
&gt; oghliner bootstrap
Bootstrapping current directory as Oghliner app&#x2026;

Your app's configuration is:

Name: offline-app
Repository: git@github.com:mykmelez/offline-app.git
Description: A template app bootstrapped with oghliner.

Your app has been bootstrapped! Just commit the changes and push the commit
to the origin/master branch:

<span>git add --all &amp;&amp; git commit -m"initial version of Oghliner app"
git push origin master</span>

Then you can build, offline, and deploy the app using gulp commands.

<span>&#x2139; For more information about building, offlining and deployment, see:
 https://mozilla.github.io/oghliner/</span>
</pre>
<p>Finally, commit the changes to complete the configuration.</p>
<pre>&gt; git add --all &amp;&amp; git commit -m"initial version of Oghliner app"
</pre>
<p>Now that your app is configured, you can build, offline, and deploy it. Bootstrapped apps include a gulpfile.js build script. To build them, install Gulp globally:</p>
<pre>&gt; npm install --global gulp
</pre>
<p>Then simply invoke gulp:</p>
<pre>&gt; gulp
</pre>
<p>To offline your app, invoke the <strong>offline</strong> command to generate the service worker that offlines your app, specifying the directory containing the files to offline.</p>

<p>All Oghliner commands are also available via a module interface, so you can integrate them into your Node-based build scripts using tools like Grunt and Gulp. If you bootstrapped your app using Oghliner, its gulpfile.js already has <strong>offline</strong> and <strong>deploy</strong> tasks (which you can also use as an alternative to the previous commands).</p>
<p>Finally, invoke the <strong>configure</strong> command to configure an app to automatically deploy to GitHub Pages using Travis CI whenever you merge a change into your app&#x2019;s master branch (provided the build completes successfully and tests pass, of course!).</p>
<pre>&gt; oghliner configure

Configuring Travis to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages&#x2026;

Your repository has a single remote, origin.
Ok, I'll configure Travis to auto-deploy the origin remote (mykmelez/offline-app).

To check the status of your repository in Travis and authorize Travis to push
to it, I'll create GitHub personal access tokens, for which I need your GitHub
username and password (and two-factor authentication code, if appropriate).

<span>&#x2139; For more information about GitHub personal access tokens, see:
 https://github.com/settings/tokens</span>

Username: mykmelez
Password: 

<span>&#xD7;</span> Checking credentials&#x2026; error!

You're using two-factor authentication with GitHub.
Please enter the code provided by your authentication software.

Auth Code: 123456

<span>&#x2139; You had an existing token for this app, so we deleted and recreated it.</span>

<span>&#x2713;</span> Checking the status of your repository in Travis&#x2026; done!

Good news, your repository is active in Travis!

<span>&#x2713;</span> Encrypting permanent GitHub token&#x2026; done!
<span>&#x2713;</span> Writing configuration to .travis.yml file&#x2026; done!

<span>&#x26A0; You didn't already have a .travis.yml file, so I created one for you.
 For more information about the file, see:
 http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build/</span>

You're ready to auto-deploy using Travis! Just commit the changes
in .travis.yml and push the commit to the origin/master branch:

<span>git add .travis.yml
git commit -m"configure Travis to auto-deploy to GitHub Pages" .travis.yml
git push origin master</span>

Then visit https://travis-ci.org/mykmelez/offline-app/builds to see the build status.
</pre>
<p>Travis will then deploy successful builds (on the master branch):</p>

<p>A few caveats to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deployments sometimes take a few minutes to show up on GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>Service Workers require that you load the app over an encrypted (HTTPS) connection. All GitHub Pages can be loaded over such a connection, even though GitHub does not officially support it.</li>
<li>Service Workers are available in Chrome, Opera, and the Developer Edition of Firefox. They&#x2019;ll ship in Firefox 44.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mozilla&#x2019;s <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Apps#Web_App_Developer_Initiative" target="_blank">Web App Developer Initiative</a> engineering team built Oghliner because we think Service Workers are a great way to offline web apps, and GitHub Pages are a great way to deploy them, so we wanted to see how much better the combination could be.</p>
<p>We&#x2019;ve used Oghliner in our own projects, like <a href="https://mykmelez.github.io/offline-web-apps-on-github-pages/" target="_blank">this presentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/platatus" target="_blank">Platatus</a>, and we hope you find it delightful. So <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/oghliner" target="_blank">learn more about it</a>, try it out, and let us know how it works for you!</p> <section class="about">
