<p>The <strong>Hello World</strong> project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let&#x2019;s get started with GitHub!</p>

<p><strong>You&#x2019;ll learn how to:</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>Create and use a repository</li>
 <li>Start and manage a new branch</li>
 <li>Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits</li>
 <li>Open and merge a pull request</li>
</ul>



<h2>What is GitHub?</h2>

<p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.</p>

<p>This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like <em>repositories</em>, <em>branches</em>, <em>commits</em>, and <em>Pull Requests</em>. You&#x2019;ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub&#x2019;s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.</p>

<h4>No coding necessary</h4>

<p>To complete this tutorial, you need a <a href="http://github.com">GitHub.com account</a> and Internet access. You don&#x2019;t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).</p>

 <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Open this guide in a separate browser window (or tab) so you can see it while you complete the steps in the tutorial.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Create a Repository</h2>

<p>A <strong>repository</strong> is usually used to organize a single project. Repositories can contain folders and files, images, videos, spreadsheets, and data sets &#x2013; anything your project needs. We recommend including a <em>README</em>, or a file with information about your project. GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. <em>It also offers other common options such as a license file.</em></p>

<p>Your <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code> repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.</p>

<h3>To create a new repository</h3>

<ol>
 <li>In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click and then select <strong>New repository</strong>.</li>
 <li>Name your repository <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code>.</li>
 <li>Write a short description.</li>
 <li>Select <strong>Initialize this repository with a README</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/create-new-repo.png" alt="new-repo-form"></p>

<p>Click <strong>Create repository</strong>. <img class="emoji" title=":tada:" alt=":tada:" src="https://assets.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f389.png" width="20"></p>



<h2>Step 2. Create a Branch</h2>

<p><strong>Branching</strong> is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time.</p>

<p>By default your repository has one branch named <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<p>When you create a branch off the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch, you&#x2019;re making a copy, or snapshot, of <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.</p>

<p>This diagram shows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch</li>
 <li>A new branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> (because we&#x2019;re doing &#x2018;feature work&#x2019; on this branch)</li>
 <li>The journey that <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> takes before it&#x2019;s merged into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/branching.png" alt="a branch"></p>

<p>Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">story.txt</code></li>
 <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">story-joe-edit.txt</code></li>
 <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.</p>

<p>Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>

<h3>To create a new branch</h3>

<ol>
 <li>Go to your new repository <code class="highlighter-rouge">hello-world</code>.</li>
 <li>Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says <strong>branch: master</strong>.</li>
 <li>Type a branch name, <code class="highlighter-rouge">readme-edits</code>, into the new branch text box.</li>
 <li>Select the blue <strong>Create branch</strong> box or hit &#x201C;Enter&#x201D; on your keyboard.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/readme-edits.gif" alt="branch gif"></p>

<p>Now you have two branches, <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">readme-edits</code>. They look exactly the same, but not for long! Next we&#x2019;ll add our changes to the new branch.</p>



<h2>Step 3. Make and commit changes</h2>

<p>Bravo! Now, you&#x2019;re on the code view for your <code class="highlighter-rouge">readme-edits</code> branch, which is a copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>. Let&#x2019;s make some edits.</p>

<p>On GitHub, saved changes are called <em>commits</em>. Each commit has an associated <em>commit message</em>, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you&#x2019;ve done and why.</p>

<h4>Make and commit changes</h4>

<ol>
 <li>Click the <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> file.</li>
 <li>Click the pencil icon in the upper right corner of the file view to edit.</li>
 <li>In the editor, write a bit about yourself.</li>
 <li>Write a commit message that describes your changes.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>Commit changes</strong> button.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/commit.png" alt="commit"></p>

<p>These changes will be made to just the README file on your <code class="highlighter-rouge">readme-edits</code> branch, so now this branch contains content that&#x2019;s different from <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</p>



<h2>Step 4. Open a Pull Request</h2>

<p>Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>, you can open a <em>pull request</em>.</p>

<p>Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a <em>pull request</em>, you&#x2019;re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show <em>diffs</em>, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.</p>

<p>As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.</p>

<p>By using GitHub&#x2019;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github/#text-formatting-toolbar">@mention system</a> in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they&#x2019;re down the hall or 10 time zones away.</p>

<p>You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It&#x2019;s a great way to learn the GitHub Flow before working on larger projects.</p>

 <li>Go ahead and delete the branch, since its changes have been incorporated, with the <strong>Delete branch</strong> button in the purple box.</li>
</ol>
