 <p>Inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">Douglas
Hofstadter&#x2019;s</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin Gardner&#x2019;s</a> deeply
profound works on mathematical series and recursion, and Joel Grus&#x2019;s talk
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThS4juptJjQ">Stupid Itertools Tricks for Data
Science</a>, I present a functional
Python implementation of extranapkins&#x2019;s series.</p>

<p>The 0th item in this series is</p>

<pre><code>"Fuck off"
</code></pre>

<p>The 1st item is</p>

<pre><code>"I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
</code></pre>

<p>The 2nd item is</p>

<pre><code>"I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>n+1</code>th item in this series is</p>

<pre><code>"I've got L_n words for you: S_n"
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>S_n</code> is the <code>n</code>th item in the series, and <code>L_n</code> is the number of words
in <code>S_n</code>, expressed in words. Thus, here is a Python function that takes the
<code>n</code>th item and returns the <code>n+1</code>th item in extranapkins&#x2019;s series:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from num2words import num2words

def next_ens(s):
 n = num2words(len(s.split()))
 return "I've got {} words for you: {}".format(n, s)
</code></pre>

<p>Given <code>next_ens()</code> we can generate successive items in the series by hand:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; next_ens('Fuck off')
"I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
&gt;&gt;&gt; next_ens(next_ens('Fuck off'))
"I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
</code></pre>

<p>We could automate this with recursion or a loop. But we can do it more quickly,
with less code, and at the same time eliminate the dangers of variable
mutation, the irritant of
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setrecursionlimit"><code>sys.setrecursionlimit</code></a>,
and the inefficiencies of <a href="http://mike.place/2016/memoization/">recursion with memoization</a>, by
using the tools of functional programming.</p>

<p>In particular we&#x2019;ll use <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/stupid-itertools-tricks-pydata/blob/master/src/stupid_tricks.py#L15-L17">Joel Grus&#x2019;s python
implementation</a>
of <a href="https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=iterate">Haskell&#x2019;s <code>iterate()</code>
function</a>. This takes a
function <code>f</code> and an initial value <code>x</code>, and returns an iterator that yields the
items in the infinite series <code>x</code>, <code>f(x)</code>, <code>f(f(x))</code>, <code>f(f(f(x)))</code>, &#x2026;
using lazy evaluation.</p>

<pre><code>from itertools import accumulate, repeat

def iterate(f, x):
 return accumulate(repeat(x), lambda fx, _: f(fx))
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to stare at <code>iterate()</code> for a while (or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThS4juptJjQ">watch Joel&#x2019;s
talk</a>) to figure out how it does
what it does. I also needed a pen and paper. Having to stare at a line for ten
minutes is part of the hazing ritual of functional programming. After a while
you can stop caring how these functions work, and take them on trust.</p>

<p>Anyway, we can use <code>next_ens()</code>, which tells you how to get from the <code>n</code>th to
the <code>n+1</code>th item, and <code>iterate()</code>, to create an iterator <code>ens</code> that yields the
items in the series&#x2026;</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; ens = iterate(next_ens, 'Fuck off')
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(ens)
'Fuck off'
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(ens)
"I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
&gt;&gt;&gt; next(ens)
"I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off"
</code></pre>

<p>&#x2026;and with Joel&#x2019;s <a href="https://github.com/joelgrus/stupid-itertools-tricks-pydata/blob/master/src/stupid_tricks.py#L9-L10">Python implementation of <code>take()</code></a>&#x2026;</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">from itertools import islice

def take(n, it):
 return [x for x in islice(it, n)]
</code></pre>

<p>&#x2026;we can evaluate the first <code>n</code> items&#x2026;</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; ens = iterate(next_ens, 'Fuck off')
&gt;&gt;&gt; take(5, ens)
['Fuck off', "I've got two words for you: Fuck off", "I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off", "I've got fourteen words for you: I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off", "I've got twenty words for you: I've got fourteen words for you: I've got eight words for you: I've got two words for you: Fuck off"]
</code></pre>

<p>&#x2026;or just the nth item:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">&gt;&gt;&gt; ens = iterate(next_ens, 'Fuck off')
&gt;&gt;&gt; take(100, ens)[-1]
"I've got nine hundred and twenty-one words for you: I've got nine hundred and twelve words for you: I've got nine hundred and three words for you: I've got eight hundred and ninety-four words for
