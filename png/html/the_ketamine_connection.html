<p>Yang explains that up to a third of ketamine patients manage to stay away from the drug, even after two years. </p>
<p>That's a high success rate compared to other drugs, he says with satisfaction. </p>
<p>The Baiyun centre is quick to show off its wide range of treatments, from acupuncture and massage to regular psychotherapy sessions. </p>
<p>Inside the &#x201C;brain functioning treatment room&#x201D;, patients recline in padded chairs, their heads encased in a warm plastic box, which plays soothing wave-like noises. </p>
<p>The procedure is supposed to relax brain waves, hopeful looking nurses explain. </p>
<p>The only patient in the room is playing on his mobile phone while the box attempts to comfort him. It doesn't appear to be working - one of his legs constantly jiggles up and down. </p>
<p>For all of its odd treatments, the Baiyun clinic is a world away from China's state-run drug treatment centres. </p>
<p>In China, more than a quarter of a million people a year are sent to mandatory rehabilitation centres. </p>
<p>Inside, inmates wear baggy, striped uniforms and men are forced to shave their heads. </p>
<p>Photos and videos show prisoners marching in long lines, their hands on the shoulders of the prisoner directly in front of them. </p>
<p>One source, who has served time in a treatment centre says he spent most of his time sitting cross-legged in rows on the floor, watching endless videos detailing the dangers of drugs. </p>
<p>As in Bristol, the Baiyun clinic also reports serious problems in the ways ketamine affects the bladder, kidneys and intestines. </p>
<p>The neurological effects of ketamine are still being explored. Most of the users at the clinic admit they cannot process their thoughts clearly any more after using the drug for so long. </p>
<p>At 25, Xiao Zhang has the forgetfulness typically seen in much older people. He often pauses in the middle of sentences, trying to remember the words he wants to use. </p>
<p>It clearly embarrasses and frustrates him. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Now, I'm slow to say what I want. I used to speak faster and use more logic,&#x201D; he says, staring at the floor. </p>
<p>A study of 25 repeated ketamine users in Hong Kong in 2013 found damage to several parts of the brain. </p>
<p>Technically, drug counsellors in Bristol and Guangdong say, ketamine isn't physically addictive. </p>
<p>An addictive drug will cause physical withdrawal symptoms when a user suddenly stops taking it - among well-known narcotics, heroin and crystal meth have that characteristic. </p>
<p>However, ketamine produces a strong compulsion in users to continue taking more. </p><aside class="scrollmation-inline ">

<p>Researchers have yet to agree on how easy it is to develop a dependence on ketamine. &#x201C;Cravings seem to be a key problem in frequent users,&#x201D; notes a drug report from the UN in 2012. </p>
<p>But more specific findings have been difficult to pin down. Even though ketamine is a decades-old drug, its new life as an illicit substance manufactured in underground laboratories is a fairly new development. </p>
<p>This makes things more complicated for researchers, who don't know if users are taking pure ketamine, or a drug that is mixed with other chemicals. </p>
<p>At the drug rehabilitation clinic karaoke music is a constant. The clinic has set up a mini karaoke room. </p>
<p>With heavy velvet curtains covering the windows and a plasticky sofa, it's a tame version of the clubs where so many of the patients first encountered ketamine. </p>
<p>A young man sways to the music, dramatically clutching his microphone. </p>
<p>&#x201C;One word from you and I was intoxicated,&#x201D; he croons. &#x201C;I never expected this. I'm holding back my tears.&#x201D; </p>
<p>Here, music is meant as a diversion. The door on the karaoke room is usually closed, as patients belt out songs, usually ballads recounting heartache and despair. </p>
<p>One patient, at least, is in a good mood. </p>
<p>Xiao Zhang meets me in a hallway near the karaoke room. He's feeling upbeat. </p>
<p>He's only completed two weeks of this program. He's supposed to stay for six more weeks, but already he's planning an early exit. He's anxious to get out in the world again. A job's waiting for him at his uncle's restaurant in Beijing. </p>
<p>&#x201C;When I leave, I want to start again, both for myself and my parents,&#x201D; he says as we walk down the clinic's hallways. </p>
<p>&#x201C;I need to change my environment, I need a new place to live. I need to stay away from my old friends, even break the connection completely.&#x201D; </p>
<p>That connection might be difficult to break. If Xiao Zhang left this clinic right now, how long would it take him to find some ketamine, if he wanted it? </p>
<p>&#x201C;One minute,&#x201D; he says, without hesitation. &#x201C;Just one minute. One phone call. 'Where are you? Wait for me&#x2026; and then you get it.'&#x201D; </p>
<div class="quoteHolder"><p>It's like an old scar. If you keep scratching it, the wound becomes bigger.&#x201D;</p></div> 
<p>Nonetheless, Xiao Zhang's optimism shines through. </p>
<p>&#x201C;Even if I make one small step, that is still progress. Life is long. I can take my time. I am still young,&#x201D; he says. </p>
<p>He stops at the end of the long hallway and looks outside, hooking his fingers around the metal bars covering the window. He's smiling. </p></div>
