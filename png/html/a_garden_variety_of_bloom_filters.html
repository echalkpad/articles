<p>In this article, I explain how <strong>Bloom filters</strong> work and introduce several
variations that evolved as a result of extensive academic treatment of this
topic. Moreover, I introduce my own implementation of these Bloom filters,
<a href="http://matthias.vallentin.net/libbf/">libBf</a>, a header-only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x">C++11</a>
library that comes with a BSD-style licence.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter">Bloom filter</a> is a randomized
<a href="http://www.pittsburgh.intel-research.net/people/gibbons/talks-surveys/Synopsis-Data-Structures-Gibbons-Matias.pdf">synopsis data structure</a> that allows for set membership queries.
Its space-efficient representation comes at the cost of <em>false positives</em>,
i.e., elements can erroneously be reported as members of the set. In practice,
the huge space savings often outweigh the false positives if kept at a
sufficiently low rate.</p>

<p>Bloom filters have received a great deal of attention not only by the research
community but also in practice. For example, <a href="http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/safe_browsing/bloom_filter.h?view=log">Google Chrome</a> uses a
Bloom filter to represent a blacklist of dangerous URLs. Each time a user is
about to navigate to new page, the corresponding URL is mangled, hashed, and
then compared to a local Bloom filter that represents the set of all malicious
URLs. If the Bloom filter reports that the URL is in the set, the browser
sends the hash of the URL to the Safebrowsing server to confirm that the URL is
indeed malicious to compensate a potential false positive. That is, all checks
are performed locally, but when the user surfs to a malicious URL, an extra
round trip to the Safebrowsing server occurs.</p>

<p>Another example is the squid web proxy which uses Bloom filters to represent
<a href="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/CacheDigests">cache digests</a>, which
caching servers use to periodically exchange the objects they contain. There
are many more examples of Bloom filter applications, for instance in
peer-to-peer applications, routing protocols, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_traceback">IP
traceback</a>, resource location, etc.
Broder and Mitzenmacher give a <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/postscripts/im2005b.pdf">good survey of network applications</a>. </p>

<p><img src="http://matthias.vallentin.net/blog/2011/06/bf-basic.png" alt="The basic Bloom filter devised by Burton Bloom. To insert an item x, we set
the corresponding positions in the bit vector to
1" class="right">
Burton Bloom introduced the original Bloom filter in 1970, which we refer to as
the <strong>basic Bloom filter</strong>. It uses a bit vector with 
and independent hash functions that map
items in to the range . (Unlike in the
implementation, we start at index 1 for the formal treatment.) All bits in
 are initialized to 0. To insert an item , we set the
bits at positions in to 1. To test whether
an item is a member of , we examine the bits
at positions in . If any of these bits is 0
we report . Otherwise we report that 
, although there remains some probability that
. This type of error is a <em>false positive</em> (FP) and also
known as <em>Bloom error</em> . It occurs because other elements in
 also map to the same positions.</p>

<p>To compute the probability of a Bloom error, we start off with an empty bit
vector and insert an item. This is the same as independently (and
uniformly) choosing bits and setting them to 1. Thereafter, the
probability that a certain bit in is still 0 is </p>

<p>Afer insertions, the probability that a certain bit is 1 is </p>

<p>Testing for membership involves hashing an item times. Thus the
probability of a Bloom error is</p>

<p>For fixed parameters and , the optimal value that
minimizes this probability is </p>

<p>For , we have hence . Moreover, for a desired FP
probability we can compute the number of required bits by
substituting the optimal value of :</p>

<h2 id="multisets">Multisets</h2>

<p>A basic Bloom filter can only represent a set, but neither allows for querying
the multiplicities of an item, nor does it support deleting entries. We use the
term <em>counting Bloom filter</em> to refer to variants of Bloom filters that
represent multisets rather than sets. In libBf, we call a counting Bloom filter
a basic Bloom filter with width parameter .</p>

<h3 id="counting">Counting</h3>

<p><img src="http://matthias.vallentin.net/blog/2011/06/bf-counting.png" alt="Each cell in the counting Bloom filter has a fixed bit width w. To insert
an item x, we increment the counters C_x. To remove an item y, we decrement its
counters C_y" class="right">
In a <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~cao/papers/summarycache.html">counting Bloom filter</a>, inserting an item corresponds to
incrementing a counter. Some variants also feature a decrement operation to
remove item from a set. As soon we allow for deletions we introduce false
negative (FN) errors. These occur when removing an item that itself was a FP.
The probability of a FN is bounded by .</p>

<p>When we get the count of an item , we compute its set of
counters and return the minimum value as frequency estimate
. This query algorithm is also known as <em>minimum
selction</em> (MS).</p>

<p>There are two main issues with counting Bloom filters:</p>

<ol><li>Counter overflows</li>
 <li>Choosing </li>
</ol><p>The first problem exists when we the counter value reaches and
cannot be incremented any more. The most natural thing to do is simply not
continuing to count rather than overflowing and restarting at 0. However, this
introduces <em>undercounts</em>, which we also refer to as FNs.</p>

<p>The second problem concerns the choice of the width parameter . If we
choose very large, the space gains of a Bloom filter diminish. There
will also be a lot of unused space, manifesting as unused zeros. If we choose
 too small, we will reach the maximum counter value to fast. Choosing
the right value is a difficult trade-off that also depends on the data. It has
been shown that for uniform distributions a value of works well.</p>

<h3 id="bitwise">Bitwise</h3>

<p><img src="http://matthias.vallentin.net/blog/2011/06/bf-bitwise.png" alt="The bitwise Bloom filter consists of l counting Bloom filters, each of which
represent w_i orders of magnitude of the entire counter. This Figure
illustrates a bitwise Bloom filter with w_i =
1." class="right">
The <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.rochester.edu/pub/papers/theory/07.tr927.Bitwise_bloom_filter.pdf">bitwise Bloom filter</a> is a combination of counting Bloom
filters with bit vectors , each of which have cells,
 hash functions, and width where .
It aims at solving both of the overflow and space problem of the counting Bloom
filter.</p>

<p>To add an item , we first look at the counters in the first level
. If there is enough room (i.e., width) available, we simply perform
the increment. If the counter overflows, we insert into and
remove it from . In this fashion, the counter value is unbounded as
we can always add more levels. However, the item has to be hashed times
with a total of hash functions.</p>

<p>In order to read the counter of an item, we combine the binary representation
of all the levels. Let be the counter value at level . Then we
compute the counter value as</p>

<h3 id="spectral">Spectral</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~matias/papers/sbf_tech_report.pdf">spectral Bloom filter</a> is an optimized version of the
counting Bloom filter. It consists of two extra algorithms in addition to MS
and introduces a more space-efficient data structure to represent counters.</p>

<ol><li>
 <p>Let us review the MS algorithm. When querying an item , MS uses
the minimum counter value as frequency estimate,
i.e., . Cohen and Matias claim that 
and for all 
.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 <p>The second spectral algorithm is an optimization for the add operation. When
adding an item to the Bloom filter, the <em>minimum increase</em> (MI)
algorithm only increments the minimum counter value(s)
. The rationale behind this is that is
always the most accurate count, thus MI results in the fewest possible
increment operations. </p>

 <p>Because not all counters are incremented on inserts, the effect of deletes
is significantly worse and the number of FNs becomes unbounded. Thus, the MI
algorithm should not be used when removing of items from a Bloom filter.
Cohen and Matias claim that and that if is drawn
uniformly from , then .</p>
 </li>
 <li>
 <p>The third algorithm is <em>recurring minimum</em> (RM) and involves two Bloom
filters, and . The key insight behind RM is that items that
experience Bloom errors are less likely to have recurring minima counter
values. Cohen and Matias found empirically that this applies to
approximately 20% of the items. Such items with a unique minimum are
maintained in the second Bloom filter to reduce the discrepancy between
 and .</p>

 <p>To query an item according to the RM algorithm, we look first
into the first Bloom filter and check if has a recurring minimum. If
so, we return the minimum counter value. Otherwise we look the minimum
counter value from the second Bloom filter, unless it is 0. If it is 0
(i.e., does not exist), we return the minimum counter from the first Bloom
filter.</p>

 <p>Since all the items are inserted into the first bloom filter, the RM
optimization does at least as well as the MS algorithm, yet has usually
better error rates because a second filter holding fewer items is used for
items which experience higher error rates.</p>
 </li>
</ol><p>The fancy data-structure takes space, where is the
number of distinct items and .

<h2 id="aging">Aging</h2>
<p>A problem all the above Bloom filter variants is that they eventually fill up
over time when dealing with a large set or stream of data. This means that at
some point the Bloom filter becomes unusable due to its high error rates. There
exist various scenarios where one would like to &#x201C;age out&#x201D; old items that have
been added a long time ago. For example, we might want to estimate only recent
items or we have a very limited amount of space available.</p>

<p>Although counting Bloom filters have a delete operation, it is often impossible
to retain old items in memory. Thus we do not know their counter positions in
the bit vector anymore, otherwise we would simply decrement their count. What
we want is a Bloom filter that has <em>sliding window</em> semantics, as
illustrated by the Figure below.</p>

<p><img src="http://matthias.vallentin.net/blog/2011/06/sliding-window.png" alt="In a sliding window scenario, an insert operation for a new item x_7 would
ideally delete an old item x_0." class="center"></p>

<p>To support a sliding window, we would like to have Bloom filter that acts like
a FIFO. In the following, we discuss two different Bloom filter flavors that
aim at providing this property.</p>

<h3 id="stable">Stable</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.85.1569">stable Bloom filter</a> is essentially a basic Bloom filter with an
underlying bit vector with a fixed cell width . However, counters do not
represent the multiplicities of the items but rather their age. Thus the
interface supports only set membership queries.</p>

<p>To insert an item, we decrement cells chosen uniformly at random.
Thereafter, we set the counters of all cells to their maximum value of
. </p>

<p>Deng and Rafiei have shown that the fraction of zeros will eventually become
constant. When having reached this <em>stable point</em>, the probability of a Bloom
error is</p>

<h3 id="asup2sup">A<sup>2</sup></h3>

<p>The <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1685986"> Bloom filter</a>, also known as <strong>active-active buffering</strong>,
provides another type of FIFO. It uses two single-bit vectors and
 where . Unlike the spectral RM
algorithm, one Bloom filter is not a subset of the other, so an item can be in
either Bloom filter.</p>

<p>To query for an item, we return true if exists in either or
. To insert an item , we simply return if it already exists in
. Otherwise we insert it in and test whether has
reached its capacity. If it is full, we flush and swap and
. Thereafter we insert the item in (the old ).</p>

<p>One advantage of the Bloom filter is space-efficiency, since one bit
vector is always full. Let the subscript denote the value of the
 Bloom filter. The probability of a Bloom error is</p>

<p>and the optimal value for and are:</p>

<h2 id="libbf">libBf</h2>

<p>As part of a class project for the course <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~satishr/cs270/">Combinatorial Algorithms and Data
Structures</a> in Spring 2011 at UC
Berkeley, I decided to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B0x">C++11</a>
<strong>lib</strong>rary of <strong>B</strong>loom <strong>f</strong>ilters, <a href="http://matthias.vallentin.net/libbf">libBf</a>, which implements the
above discussed Bloom filters. <a href="http://matthias.vallentin.net/course-work/cs270-s11.pdf">Slides</a> of the
final presentation are also available; they go a little deeper into the
algorithmic details.</p>



<p>I only presented a few Bloom filter types in this article, but active research
in this field yielded many more variations. For example, the <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.151.8477">dynamic</a>
and <a href="http://gsd.di.uminho.pt/members/cbm/ps/dbloom.pdf">scalable</a> Bloom filter are two variants that grow dynamically
as soon as more items are added. Bloom filters can also be
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~michaelm/NEWWORK/postscripts/cbf.pdf">compressed</a>, e.g., when sending them over the network.
<a href="http://www.siam.org/proceedings/alenex/2006/alx06_004akirsch.pdf">Distance-sensitive</a> Bloom filters give more than a binary answer or
count when asking for an item: they also return if an item is close to another
item in the set. Finally, there exist <a href="http://webee.technion.ac.il/~ayellet/Ps/nelson.pdf">Bloomier</a> filters which
extend the set membership query model and counting notion to computations of
arbitrary functions.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuckoo_hashing">Cuckoo hashing</a> is a related
space-efficient alternative to Bloom filters. Moreover, Adam Langley has some
<a href="http://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/04/29/filters.html">interesting thoughts</a>
on Golomb Compressed Sets.</p>
