<p>In this series I wanna discuss my learning experience with <code>ReactJS</code>, this will be an opinionated series on what I think of <code>ReactJS</code> &amp; other libraries, Why I switched to it, and why I think <code>ReactJS</code> is <em>awesome</em>, along side all the opinions I will be sharing code on what I am learning and explaining how it all works.</p>

<h3 id="whyibotheredlearninganewframework">Why I bothered learning a new framework</h3>

<p>I've been a frontend developer for a while now, the last 4 years my work was mostly <code>AngularJS 1.x</code> &amp; <code>EmberJS</code> and I think I'm comfortable with both.</p>

<p>For me it all started by checking out <code>AngularJS</code> and building small apps with it, until the apps I was working on got bigger, I learned about <code>AngularJS</code> more &amp; knew that the code I wrote was terrible and need a BIG refactoring <em>(I think this happened to most)</em>, because <code>AngularJS</code> is pretty relaxed, there is no restrictions on where to put things, and that was one of the biggest dis-advantages. at least from my perspective</p>

<p>Then life went by and then I started working with a project built with <code>EmberJS</code> I think it was still in beta, and I had a really difficult time learning it, the concepts were totally different from <code>AngularJS</code> and I hated it at first.</p>

<p>After that it all clicked, and I <strong>LOVED</strong> <code>EmberJS</code> <em>(And still loving it)</em> been working with it exclusively on various projects for the last couple of years.</p>

<p>Until one of my tasks was to make a big app more performant, the problem was that there were too many <code>properties</code> &amp; <code>observers</code> so any change triggered list refresh multiple times, dealing with the meta language of ember and the two way bindings was just too much headache, during that time, <code>React</code> was on fire and I decided to take a look, at first honestly I though its just too difficult, then now even tho I didn't work on any real/big projects with <code>React</code> it is my new favourite Library </p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Note: ember team agrees and they are embracing all the core <code>React</code> concepts and they are in the process of integrating them in ember, but this topic is for another article</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="settinguptheenvironment">Setting up the environment</h3>

<p><code>React</code> doesn't come with a build tool to init the app, instead you have to do it manually.</p>

<p>React is a low level library and they want to keep it that way, not providing you with a tool like <code>ember-cli</code> for generating/running/deploying the app is a bit frustrating, but honestly giving you the option to choose whatever you want gives you a lot of possibilities like using cutting edge transpilers for using ES7 with react or honestly anything you could ever think of.</p>

<p>Our module loader/bundler + transpiler will be <a href="https://webpack.github.io/">webpack</a> + <a href="https://babeljs.io/">babel</a></p>

<h4 id="initializetheapplication">Initialize the Application</h4>

<p>first install <code>webpack</code> globally by running <br>
<code>npm install -g webpack</code></p>

<p>To create a new react application, create a new folder and run the following commands</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>npm init</code> </p></li>
<li><p>npm install the following list</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>"dependencies": {
 "babel-loader": "^6.2.0",
 "babel-plugin-add-module-exports": "^0.1.2",
 "babel-plugin-react-html-attrs": "^2.0.0",
 "babel-plugin-transform-class-properties": "^6.3.13",
 "babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy": "^1.3.4",
 "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.3.13",
 "babel-preset-react": "^6.3.13",
 "babel-preset-stage-0": "^6.3.13",
 "react": "^0.14.6",
 "react-dom": "^0.14.6",
 "webpack": "^1.12.9",
 "webpack-dev-server": "^1.14.1"
 },
</code></pre>

<p>let me explain some of the packages introduced in the list above</p>

<p><a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html">wepack-dev-server</a>: a tool for running <code>webpack</code> command in watch mode so whenever any file is changed the compilation happens and fires up a localhost server that serves all the files</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/facebook/react">react|react-dom</a> after <code>react-native</code> was introduced, the react team figured out the need for extracting a single library that will be used everywhere and created a web specific library that handles the dom aspect of the web, which is now <code>react-dom</code> </p>

<p><strong>babel presets</strong>: presets are bunch of plugins associated together, like <code>es2015</code> allows the user to write <code>ES6</code>, <code>react</code> allows you to write <code>jsx</code> and <code>stage-0</code> allows the user to write all cutting edge <code>ES7</code> stuff</p>



<h4 id="configurewebpack">Configure webpack</h4>

<p>create a new <code>./webpack.config.js</code> that contains the following </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">var debug = process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production"; 
var webpack = require('webpack'); 
var path = require('path');

module.exports = { 
 context: path.join(__dirname, "src"),
 devtool: debug ? "inline-sourcemap" : null,
 entry: "./js/app.js",
 module: {
 loaders: [
 {
 test: /\.js?$/,
 exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
 loader: 'babel-loader',
 query: {
 presets: ['react', 'es2015', 'stage-0'],
 plugins: ['react-html-attrs', 'transform-class-properties', 'transform-decorators-legacy'],
 }
 }
 ]
 },
 output: {
 path: __dirname + "/src/",
 filename: "app.min.js"
 },
 plugins: debug ? [] : [
 new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin(),
 new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
 new webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin({ mangle: false, sourcemap: false }),
 ],
};
</code></pre>

<p>The two interesting properties here are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>entry</code>: which will be our entry point to the app the first script that runs, and through it, loads the rest of the app</p></li>
<li><p><code>output</code>: this is the result when running webpack, this will be referenced in <code>index.html</code> that we will create bellow</p></li>
</ul>

<p>this is a pretty basic webpack config that checks the env, if its production will optimize the code by uglifying it and removing duplicate code and sourcemaps.</p>

<p>There is a concepts in <code>webpack</code> <em>(actually <code>babel</code>)</em> which is called <a href="https://github.com/babel/babel-loader">loaders</a> through them we can write <em>(ES6, ES7, JSX, ...)</em>, and it will compile all that to <code>ES5</code> and will run on all browsers, take a look at the previous link for more info</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Note <code>webpack</code> is not exclusive for react, its recommended using it or any other build system (<code>Grunt</code>, <code>Gulp</code>, ..) for any Javascript application</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
 <p>Note by using <code>webpack</code> you will install most of the dependencies from <code>npm</code> not <code>bower</code> and you <strong>can</strong> reference it from the code, <code>webpack</code> will figure how to handle all that for you <em>(and yes <code>npm</code> is also a good package manager for the web)</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point we are done with creating our small build system, its a little effort at first, but it makes our life so much easier, specially when the project grows</p>



<h4 id="cooltiponrunningyourapp">Cool tip on running your app</h4>

<p>One of the dependencies for our app is <code>webpack-dev-server</code>, you could start the app by running </p>

<pre><code>webpack-dev-server 
</code></pre>

<p>This will actually not work, we need to tell it the base of our app is inside <code>src</code>, so we would run it with the following instead</p>

<pre><code>webpack-dev-server --content-base src 
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of doing this every time that we would want to run our app, we could add a command in <code>scripts</code> in our <code>package.json</code> </p>

<pre><code> "dependencies": {
 ...
 },
 "scripts": {
 "dev": "./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --content-base src --inline --hot",
 "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" &amp;&amp; exit 1"
 },
</code></pre>

<p>We are passing two extra flags </p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>--inline</code>: this will not show a status bar at the top (shows by default)</p></li>
<li><p><code>--hot</code> this enables hot module replacement, awesome feature, instead of refreshing the whole page, it just replaces the components that was edited, read more about it <a href="https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement-with-webpack.html">here</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now whenever we want to run the app we would type <code>npm run dev</code> </p>



<h4 id="basicappstructure">Basic App Structure</h4>

<p>our directory structure should look like this </p>

<pre><code>&gt; node_modules/
&gt; src/
 &gt; js/
 - app.js
 &gt; components/
 - Hello-World.js
 - index.html
- package.json
- webpack.config.js
</code></pre>



<p><code>./index.html</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Learning React Series&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;

 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;div id="app"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;script src="app.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>This is just blank html boilerplate, the only interesting part that we are referencing <code>app.min.js</code> <em>(that we specified in the <code>webpack.config.js</code>)</em></p>



<p><code>./js/app.js</code></p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import React from "react"; 
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import HelloWorld from "./components/Hello-World";

const app = document.getElementById('app'); 
ReactDOM.render(&lt;App/&gt;, app); 
</code></pre>

<p>pretty basic file, just renders the <code>Hello-World</code> component</p>



<p><code>./js/components/Hello-World.js</code> </p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">import React from "react";

export default class HelloWorld extends React.Component { 
 render() {
 let msg = "Extra Message from React"
 return (
 &lt;div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;Hello World!&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div&gt;{msg}&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;/div&gt;
 );
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>A really simple <code>react</code> component, just renders </p>

<pre><code class="language-plain">Hello Message 
Extra Message from React 
</code></pre>

<p>That's it in my next article will be talking about react basics and what is <code>DDAU</code> <em>(Data down action up)</em>, until next time, have an awesome day</p>
