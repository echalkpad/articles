				<p>This is&#xA0;<em>cron.weekly</em> edition #13 for Sunday January 31st, 2016.</p>
<p>I realise it&#x2019;s a bit last minute, but if you&#x2019;re free today and interested in an open source conference in Brussels, Belgium, come by at&#xA0;<a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/">FOSDEM</a>. I&#x2019;ll be speaking in the <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/track/php_and_friends/">PHP &amp; friends room</a> about HTTP/2!</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/2402"> Systemd mounted efivarfs read-write, allowing motherboard bricking via &#x2018;rm&#x2019;</a></h2>
<p>A bug/security issue on systemd, but more interesting is the discussion around it: the difficult trade-off between convenience&#xA0;and ease-of-use of a software project vs. secure &amp; safe defaults. One decision attracts a wider audience, the other makes it a very focussed , secure, project that requires everyone who&#xA0;actually wants to use it, to change those default parameters. Interesting point-of-views.</p>
<h2><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=811377">sysvinit packages on Debian need maintainers</a></h2>
<p>Now that Debian has moved (mostly) to systemd, the sysvinit packages are no longer maintained. The project is looking for&#xA0;someone to step up and&#xA0;maintain the&#xA0;legacy sysvinit packages.</p>

<h2><a href="https://keepingitclassless.net/2016/01/unspoken-benefits-open-networking/">The Unspoken Benefits of Open Networking</a></h2>
<p>The networking area is typically a very closed, vendor-driven market. Open Networking tries to change that by introducing SDN (Software Defined Networking), automation, open source firmware/OS&#x2019;s, &#x2026; This post dives further into that concept of Open Networking.</p>
<h2><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tails-20-out">Tails 2.0 released</a></h2>
<p>Tails, the privacy focussed live Operating System, has reached a stable 2.0 release.</p>
<h2><a href="https://segment.com/blog/automating-our-infrastructure/">Syncing Dev Environments &amp; Automating Infrastructure</a></h2>
<p>If you&#x2019;re a sysadmin, chances are you&#x2019;re managing multiple environments that should all be as equal to each other as possible. This post introduces Docker and how they moved away from Terraform to accomplish this.</p>
<h2><a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rubyonrails-security">Ruby on Rails security updates</a></h2>

<h2><a href="http://marc.info/?l=openssl-announce&amp;m=145399448602327&amp;q=raw">OpenSSL Security Advisory</a></h2>
<p>Last Friday, the OpenSSL team announced a high severity patch that fixes a Diffie-Hellman key exchange vulnerability.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html">Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software</a></h2>
