<div><div id="frag_2" class="page_fragment"><div class="abstract svAbstract "><p id="spar0010">Neuroscience has demonstrated that individual differences in cognitive task performance are closely linked to differences in brain activity. Neurofeedback training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can effectively change specific localized brain activity. Various studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that self-regulation of specific brain activity can be learned with fMRI neurofeedback, and leads to specific corresponding behavioral changes. Initial evidence for cognitive enhancement due to fMRI neurofeedback include the domains of perception, motor performance, and memory. Although further conceptual and technical advances are needed to overcome current limitations of this novel method, its non-invasiveness and compatibility with other behavioral or pharmacological approaches promise that it will become a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement.</p></div><div class="textboxdefault" id="tb0005"><div id="tde"><div class="textboxBody"><p class="svArticle section" id="par0030"><strong class="boldFont">Current Opinion in Behavioral Sciences</strong> 2015, <strong class="boldFont">4</strong>:xx&#x2013;yy</p><p class="svArticle section" id="par0035">This review comes from a themed issue on <strong class="boldFont">Cognitive enhancement</strong></p><p class="svArticle section" id="par0040">Edited by <strong class="boldFont">Barbara Sahakian</strong> and <strong class="boldFont">Arthur Kramer</strong><br></p><p class="svArticle section" id="par0045"><span id="intr0005" class="interref"><strong class="boldFont">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cobeha.2015.05.001</strong></span></p><p class="svArticle section" id="par0050">2352-1546/Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p></div></div></div><h2 class="svArticle" id="sec0005">Introduction</h2><p class="svArticle section" id="par0055">Neuroscientific research has firmly established that individual differences in cognitive task performance are closely linked to differences in brain functioning. For example, the level of activity in specialized brain areas such as the visual cortex, which can change spontaneously and as a function of perceptual training or attention, is associated with improved visual detection [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0335" id="bbib0335" class="intra_ref">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0340" id="bbib0340" class="intra_ref">2</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0345" id="bbib0345" class="intra_ref">3</a>]. This also holds for more complex cognitive functions such as working memory and intelligence, which are associated with specific patterns of activity, in particular the prefrontal cortex [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0350" id="bbib0350" class="intra_ref">4</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0355" id="bbib0355" class="intra_ref">5</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0360" id="bbib0360" class="intra_ref">6</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0365" id="bbib0365" class="intra_ref">7</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0370" id="bbib0370" class="intra_ref">8</a>]. Damage to these brain areas can result in severe visual impairment, or memory problems, respectively [<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0335" id="bbib0335" class="intra_ref">1</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0375" id="bbib0375" class="intra_ref">9</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0380" id="bbib0380" class="intra_ref">10</a>]. The close link between cognitive task performance and brain states strongly suggests that optimizing brain activity improves cognitive performance. Neurofeedback is a promising approach to manipulating brain states that is non-invasive and does not require pharmacological substances. The rationale behind cognitive enhancement based on neurofeedback is to train participants to reach brain states that have been identified to correspond to optimum levels of task performance. Depending on the task, the optimal brain states that ought to be trained with neurofeedback can be associated with enhanced attention, particular mental strategies, brain patterns evoked by specific stimuli, or any other brain state that might be promising to increase task performance. For example, improved visual sensitivity has been achieved by neurofeedback training of attention-related increases in spontaneous visual cortex activity [<sup><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0385" id="bbib0385" class="intra_ref">11&#x2022;&#x2022;</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0390" id="bbib0390" class="intra_ref">12</a></sup>], as well as by training visual cortex activation patterns that corresponded to a specific visual stimulus [<span id="bbib0395"><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0395" id="ancbbib0395" class="intra_ref">13<sup>&#x2022;&#x2022;</sup></a></span>].</p><h2 class="svArticle" id="sec0010">Neurofeedback</h2><p class="svArticle section" id="par0060">Neurofeedback training is accomplished by continuously measuring brain activity, analyzing it in real-time, and then providing feedback regarding the current brain state to the participant [<sup><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0400" id="bbib0400" class="intra_ref">14&#x2022;&#x2022;</a>, <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0405" id="bbib0405" class="intra_ref">15&#x2022;</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0410" id="bbib0410" class="intra_ref">16</a></sup>] (<span id="bfig0005"><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#fig0005" id="ancbfig0005" class="intra_ref">Figure 1</a></span>).
