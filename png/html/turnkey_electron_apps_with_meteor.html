 <p class="mb++"><em>Mixmax is a communications platform that brings email into the 21st century. We believe everything you do today on the web should be possible in any email.</em></p>
 <p>Last month, we released our first desktop application to
<a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/mixmax-live-for-mac">rave reviews</a>. After several
improvements and the release of the Windows version, we&#x2019;re pulling back the curtain to reveal how we
built the&#xA0;app.</p>



<p>When we decided to make a desktop application, <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron</a> was
an easy choice. Using a cross-platform framework would allow us to reach the most users, critical for
a business at our early stage. Using a framework based on web technologies would allow us to reuse
parts of our web application&#x2014;and best leverage the talent behind it, in particular
<a href="https://twitter.com/chanpory">our designer</a>&#x2019;s marvelous <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> skills. And using a
framework based on Chromium would give us access to the same bleeding-edge web APIs we use in our web
application in our desktop&#xA0;app.</p>

<p>But with that choice made, there were still a number of questions remaining: how would&#xA0;we&#x2026;</p>

<ul>
 <li>load our web application in&#xA0;Electron?</li>
 <li>package the app?</li>
 <li>communicate between the web and native parts of the&#xA0;app?</li>
 <li>distribute the app?</li>
</ul>

<p>To answer these questions, we reviewed a ton of Electron documentation, GitHub issues, and prior
art. The result is a Meteor package, <a href="https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron">meteor-electron</a>,
that makes it as easy as <code>meteor add quark:electron</code> to get your Meteor application running
in a native shell. If you&#x2019;d like to try it out, head on over to the GitHub repo; but if you&#x2019;re
interested in its development, read&#xA0;on!</p>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>We developed our Electron infrastructure as a Meteor package because the web application we were
wrapping was a Meteor application, but the techniques and lessons described below would in large part
apply to packaging any web application (using Rails, Django, Express, etc.) as an Electron&#xA0;app.</p>

<p>With that said, Meteor facilitates a particularly smooth workflow in that its packages can hook
into the build process, server, <em>and</em> client. As you will see, Electron development requires
coordinating changes across all three of those&#xA0;areas.</p>

<h2 id="meteor-in-the-cloud--electron-on-the-desktop">Meteor in the cloud, Electron on the&#xA0;desktop</h2>

<p>We first came across a prototype of meteor-electron when deciding how to load our Meteor app in
Electron: remotely or locally? There were <a href="https://github.com/sircharleswatson/Electrometeor">several</a>
<a href="https://github.com/arboleya/electrify">packages</a> that promised to do the latter&#x2014;build and
run Meteor <em>inside</em> the Electron app. But that decision came with
<a href="https://github.com/sircharleswatson/Electrometeor#windows-1">limited</a>
<a href="https://github.com/arboleya/electrify#notes">support</a> for building the app for multiple
platforms. The primary advantage of the local approach seemed to be offline support&#x2014;but we didn&#x2019;t need
that for v1. More important to us was getting a cross-platform app out as soon as possible and being
able to quickly iterate upon it. That made the case for loading Meteor remotely even more strongly,
since we could use Meteor&#x2019;s <a href="http://info.meteor.com/blog/hot-code-pushes">hot code push</a>
to update the bulk of the&#xA0;app.</p>

<h2 id="automatic-packaging">Automatic packaging</h2>

<p>We were also attracted to meteor-electron by its focus on ease of use. Where other projects
foregrounded customization and build processes, meteor-electron got us started right away. When we
added its package to our app, it automatically downloaded the Electron binary for our system, packaged
our application, and opened it in a native&#xA0;shell.</p>

<p>The packaging step bears some discussion: the officially-supported way to package an Electron app
is to <a href="http://electron.atom.io/docs/v0.36.0/tutorial/application-distribution/">manually edit
the contents of the Electron binary</a>! That&#x2019;s crazy. Under the hood, meteor-electron uses the
excellent community project <a href="https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager">electron-packager</a>
to bundle your code and resources. What&#x2019;s more, meteor-electron uses reasonable defaults for packaging,
<a href="https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron#configuration">easily customizable</a> through
your <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/meteor_settings">Meteor.settings</a>&#xA0;file.</p>

<p>This turn-key packaging was a great user experience, and one that we&#x2019;ve enhanced working with
meteor-electron&#x2019;s creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/rissem">Mike Risse</a>. For instance, we&#x2019;ve
since improved the project to automatically rebuild and relaunch the app when the native code or the
application settings&#xA0;change.</p>

<h2 id="safe-native-bridge">Safe native bridge</h2>

<p>Once we had our application loading in meteor-electron, we started to consider how we could
customize it for the native context. Some simple
<a href="https://github.com/rissem/meteor-electron/blob/4561e0156152267d00a68e147e54875e7b8f8823/client/index.js#L8">feature detection APIs</a>
were trivial to add thanks to meteor-electron&#x2019;s ability, as a Meteor package, to load code on the server
(like the packaging logic) <em>and</em> the&#xA0;client.</p>

<p>Providing the client with access to native capabilities was trickier. Or should I say, it was
<em>too </em>easy: by default, all Node APIs and modules are accessible from web&#xA0;content.</p>

<p>Electron assumes that you will be loading your <span class="caps">HTML</span> etc. from disk, and thus views it as a trusted
extension of the native code. But this assumption fails disastrously for hybrid native-web applications
like Meteor desktop&#xA0;apps.</p>



<p>Thankfully, it is possible to disable this Node integration when opening browser windows. (Bonus:
doing so can fix web dependencies failing to load by incorrectly assuming they&#x2019;re
<a href="https://github.com/atom/electron/issues/254">running in a CommonJS environment</a>.)</p>

<p>We do still wish to expose <em>certain </em>native APIs to the web content. Luckily, there exists
a mechanism for doing so called a &#x201C;preload script&#x201D;. This script is loaded before other
scripts run in the page; always has access to Node APIs, no matter whether Node integration is turned
on or off; and can add symbols to the page&#x2019;s global scope. With Node integration turned off:

</p><table class="offset-table">
 <thead>
 <tr>
 <th></th>
 <th>&#xA0;&#xA0;Native scripts&#xA0;&#xA0;</th>
 <th>&#xA0;&#xA0;Preload script&#xA0;&#xA0;</th>
 <th>&#xA0;&#xA0;Browser scripts</th>
 </tr>
 </thead>
 <tbody>
 <tr>
 <td>Access to Node global context</td>
 <td class="arrow-line-through">&lt;</td>
 <td class="arrow-line-through right-arrow-line-through">&gt;</td>
 <td></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
 <td>Access to browser global context</td>
 <td></td>
 <td class="arrow-line-through">&lt;</td>
 <td class="arrow-line-through right-arrow-line-through">&gt;</td>
 </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<br>

This means that the preload script can provide the webpage with indirect access to select Node&#xA0;APIs:



<p>meteor-electron&#x2019;s use of a preload script thus makes it possible for Meteor apps to safely
make use of native&#xA0;functionality.</p>

<h2 id="distribution:-to-be-continued---">Distribution: to be&#xA0;continued&#x2026;</h2>

<p>You&#x2019;ve seen thus far how meteor-electron offers Meteor developers a simple and safe path to creating
desktop applications. In part 2 of this blog post, we&#x2019;ll talk about how meteor-electron adds support
for distribution, even automatic updates, without developers having to add any server-side code&#xA0;themselves.</p>
