 <p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-1">WHEN crack hit America in the mid-1980s, for African-Americans, to borrow from Ta-Nehisi Coates, civilization fell. Crack embodied instant and fatal addiction; we saw endless images of thin, ravaged bodies, always black, as though from a famined land. And always those desperate, cracked lips. Our hearts broke learning the words &#x201C;crack baby.&#x201D;</p><aside id="middle-right-paid-post-container" class="ad middle-right-ad paid-post-ad hidden nocontent robots-nocontent">
 
 
 </aside><p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-2">But mostly, crack meant shocking violence, terrifying gangs and hollowed-out inner cities. For those living in crack-plagued areas, the devastation was all too real. Children learned which ways home were safe and which gang to join to avoid beatings, or worse.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Even for those of us African-Americans living at a relatively safe distance, there were soul-deadening costs. City centers, and by extension black neighborhoods, were seen in the national imagination as lawless landscapes. We were warned of a new wave of &#x201C;super predators,&#x201D; young, faceless black men wearing bandannas and sagging jeans. The addicted, those who preyed on them and those caught by class, geography and especially race were swept together. At the edges of my 12-year-old mind was the ominous sense that no matter how far crack was from my actual life, I was somehow associated with the scourge.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Once again, African-Americans were cast as pathological, an indistinguishable and unsympathetic mass. The plight of Black America was evidence of its collective moral failure &#x2014; of welfare mothers and rock-slinging thugs &#x2014; and a reason to cut off all help. Blacks would just have to pull themselves out of the crack epidemic. Until then, the only answer lay in cordoning off the wreckage with militarized policing.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">The dormant carrier of this ill-defined disease, harboring a mix of criminality and violence, was the young black male. By my high school years there was no doubting the danger strangers saw radiating off me. When I was in college in the early 1990s, my short dreadlocks meant older women would cross the street to avoid me.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">Thirty years later, America is again seeing an epidemic of <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/drug-abuse-and-dependence/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="In-depth reference and news articles about Drug abuse and dependence." class="meta-classifier">drug addiction</a>, particularly heroin. The surge is so great that for the first time in generations, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/science/drug-overdoses-propel-rise-in-mortality-rates-of-young-whites.html?login=email&amp;mtrref=undefined">mortality among young white adults has risen</a>. But the national attitude toward drug addiction is utterly different. Even Republican presidential candidates are eschewing the perennial tough-on-drugs speeches and opening up about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=556lEnWH-4I">struggles</a> within their own <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/19/opinion/campaign-stops/just-saying-yes-to-the-politics-of-drugs.html">families</a>.</p> <aside class="marginalia related-coverage-marginalia marginalia-item nocontent robots-nocontent">
 
 </aside>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-3">More important, police chiefs in the cities most affected by heroin are responding not by invoking military metaphors, weapons and tactics but by ensuring that police officers save <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/13/nyregion/anti-overdose-drug-becoming-an-everyday-part-of-police-work.html">lives</a> and get people into <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/police-department-offers-heroin-addicts-amnesty-treatment_us_55ce238de4b07addcb42d96c">rehab</a>. As one former narcotics officer <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/us/heroin-war-on-drugs-parents.html?_r=0">described</a> his change of heart on addiction, &#x201C;These are people and they have a purpose in life and we can&#x2019;t as law enforcement look at them any other way.&#x201D; In his inability to name the change that allowed this epiphany, his words also capture our cringe-worthy self-denial. Suddenly, police officers understand crime as a sign of underlying addiction requiring coordinated assistance, rather than a scourge to be eradicated.</p>
 	<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-4">It is hard to describe the bittersweet sting that many African-Americans feel witnessing this national embrace of addicts. It is heartening to see the eclipse of the generations-long failed war on drugs. But black Americans are also knowingly weary and embittered by the absence of such enlightened thinking when those in our own families were similarly wounded. When the face of addiction had dark skin, this nation&#x2019;s police did not see sons and daughters, sister and brothers. They saw &#x201C;brothas,&#x201D; young thugs to be locked up, rather than &#x201C;people with a purpose in life.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-5">To be clear, no one laments the violence that the &#x201C;crack bomb&#x201D; set off in inner cities more than African-Americans. But while shootings, beatings and robberies cannot be tolerated anywhere, the heroin epidemic shows that how we respond to the crimes accompanying addiction depends on how much we care about the victims of crime and those in the grip of addiction. White heroin addicts get overdose treatment, rehabilitation and reincorporation, a system that will be there for them <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/25/us/massachusetts-chiefs-tack-in-drug-war-steer-addicts-to-rehab-not-jail.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=first-column-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news&amp;_r=0?login=email">again and again and again</a>.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-6">It would be cruel and perverse to seek equal abandonment of those now struggling with addiction as payback for the failures of the &#x2019;80s. Nor do I write in mere hopes of inducing cheap racial guilt. The hope, however vain, is that we learn from our meanest moments.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" id="story-continues-7">Even today, as black communities face pressing problems of addiction and chronic unemployment and the discrimination in hiring that helps to perpetuate it, many are dedicated to ignoring racial prejudice. Faced with searing examples of unconscionable police violence against unarmed black men, of concocted justifications laid bare by video, too many still speak of isolated cases and overblown racial hysteria. With condescending finger-wagging, others recite the deplorable statistics of violence within poor minority neighborhoods as though racist policing were an antidote or excuse. Both responses ignore that each spectacular moment of unjustified police violence represents countless instances of institutionalized racial control across generations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content">No sane community faced with addiction and crime would invite or acquiesce to brutal policing as their fate, and no moral community would impose it as a primary response. We do not have to wait until a problem has a white face to answer with humanity.</p>
