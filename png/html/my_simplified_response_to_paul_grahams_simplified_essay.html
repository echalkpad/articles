Paul Graham published a <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/sim.html">simplified version of his essay on income inequality</a>. &#xA0;Here's my simplified response:<br>
<br>
It is true that many socially worthwhile activities (like developing technology, and starting startups) produce income and wealth disparities. &#xA0;And a certain amount of income and wealth disparity is not a bad thing. &#xA0;In fact, having no income and wealth disparity is a bad thing. &#xA0;We <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">tried it</a>. &#xA0;It didn't work. &#xA0;No reasonable person disputes this.<br>
<br>
However, too much income and wealth disparity is also not a good thing. &#xA0;I hope I don't have to convince you that if all of the wealth in a society is controlled by a single family or individual, that's not good. &#xA0;The optimal point lies somewhere in between those two extremes.<br>
<br>
Today, <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2014/01/20/264241052/oxfam-worlds-richest-1-percent-control-half-of-global-wealth">the top 1% control fully half of the planet's wealth</a>. &#xA0;That is awfully close to the second extreme. &#xA0;It's very unlikely that this is where the happy medium lies.<br>
<br>
It's particularly worrisome because, as income and wealth disparity increases, there is a positive-feedback effect that tends to drive it further and further towards the second extreme: the extremely wealthy use their disposable income to buy political influence, which they then use to get laws passed that favor them at the expense of others (e.g. through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_of_private_equity_and_hedge_funds">regressive taxation</a>). &#xA0;This lets the already-wealthy accumulate more wealth not by creating more value, but by collecting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_rent">economic rents</a>. &#xA0;In the long run this leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligarchy">oligarchy</a> and possibly even economic and societal collapse. &#xA0;We are nowhere near there, but by the time it becomes apparent that this is happening it will almost certainly be too late to do anything about it. &#xA0;The time to act is now, before it becomes an even more serious problem.<br>
<br>
(Paul Graham, like nearly everyone in today's politics, fails to appreciate the near-universal validity, at least when it comes to social and economic policy, of Ron's First Law: All extreme positions are wrong. &#xA0;:-)<br>
