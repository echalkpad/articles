(we call them <em>roots</em>).</li><li>Watchman does not follow symlinks. It knows they exist, but they show up
the same as any other file in its reporting.</li><li>Watchman waits for a <em>root</em> to settle down before it will start
to trigger notifications or command execution.</li><li>Watchman is conservative, preferring to err on the side of caution;
it considers files to be freshly changed when you start to
watch them or when it is unsure.</li><li>You can query a root for file changes since you last checked, or the
current state of the tree</li><li>You can subscribe to file changes that occur in a root</li></ul><h2><a class="anchor" name="quickstart"></a>Quickstart <a class="hash-link" href="https://facebook.github.io/watchman/#quickstart">#</a></h2><p>These two lines establish a watch on a source directory and then set up a
trigger named <code>buildme</code> that will run a tool named <code>minify-css</code> whenever a CSS
file is changed. The tool will be passed a list of the changed filenames.</p><p class="prism language-javascript">$ watchman watch <span class="token operator">~</span><span class="token operator">/</span>src
