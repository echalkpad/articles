					<p>True story: it&#x2019;s possible to <em>fly</em> through your own secondary math education &#x2013; honor roll bumper sticker on your mom&#x2019;s minivan and all &#x2013;&#xA0;but miss some of the Very Big Ideas of secondary math.</p>
<p>For one example: in <a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/if-simplifying-rational-expressions-is-aspirin-then-how-do-you-create-the-headache/">our last post on simplifying rational expressions</a>, the process of turning a lengthy rational expression into a simpler one,&#xA0;<a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/if-simplifying-rational-expressions-is-aspirin-then-how-do-you-create-the-headache/comment-page-1/#comment-2409318">Bill F writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another benefit of evaluating both expressions for a set of values is to emphasize the equivalence of both expressions. Students lose the thread that simplifying creates equivalent expressions. All too often the process is seen as a bunch-of-math-steps-that-the-teacher-tells-us-to-do. When asked, &#x201C;what did those steps accomplish?&#x201D; blank stares are often seen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Past a certain point, those operations are trivial. But it&#x2019;s only past a point much farther in the distance that the <em>understanding</em> &#x2013; these two rational expressions are <em>equivalent</em> &#x2013;&#xA0;becomes trivial.</p>
<p>For another example: I left high school adept at graphing functions. I could complete the square and change forms easily. I knew how to identify the asymptotes, holes, and limiting behavior of those thorny rational expressions. But it wasn&#x2019;t until I had graduated university math and was several years into <em>teaching</em> that I really, really understood that the graph is a picture of all the points that make the function <em>true</em>. This was difficult for me because graphs don&#x2019;t often <em>look</em> like a bunch of points. They look like a <em>line</em></p>
<p>That&#x2019;s one reason I&#x2019;m excited about <a href="http://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder">the Desmos Activity Builder</a> and this activity I made in it last week, <a href="https://student.desmos.com/?prepopulateCode=xffk">Loco for Loci</a>!</p>
<p>It asks students to place a point anywhere on a graph so that it makes a particular relationship <em>true</em>. Then it asks the students to imagine what <em>all of our points</em> would look like if we pictured them on the same graph. Then the teacher can show the results, underscoring this Very Big Idea that I didn&#x2019;t fully appreciate my first time through high school &#x2013; what we eventually think of as a continuous line is a picture of lots and lots of points.</p>
<p>Here is what happened when 300 people on Twitter played along:</p>
<p>&#x201C;Drag the green point so that it&#x2019;s the same distance from both blue points.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_1hi.png"><img src="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_1lo-1024x890.png" alt="150811_1lo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23603"></a></p>
<p>Trickier: &#x201C;Drag the green point so that it&#x2019;s five units from both blue points.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_2hi.png"><img src="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_2lo-1024x885.png" alt="150811_2lo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23601"></a></p>
<p>Whimsical: &#x201C;Drag the green point so it is the same distance from a) the line of dinosaurs and b) the big dinosaur.&#x201D; I really couldn&#x2019;t have hoped for better here.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_3hi.png"><img src="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_3lo-1024x652.png" alt="150811_3lo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23599"></a></p>
<p>And then a couple of very interesting misfires.</p>
<p>&#x201C;Drag the green point so that it&#x2019;s four units from the blue point.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_5hi.png"><img src="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_5lo-1024x888.png" alt="150811_5lo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23595"></a></p>
<p>&#x201C;Drag the green point so that a line segment is formed with a slope of .5.&#x201D;</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_4hi.png"><img src="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/wp-content/uploads/150811_4lo-1024x888.png" alt="150811_4lo" width="500" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-23597"></a></p>
<p>You could run a semester-long master&#x2019;s seminar on the misconceptions in that last graph.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Maybe more like ten quick seconds at the start of your Algebra class.</p>
<p>If you&#x2019;d like to run this activity with your own students, here is <a href="https://teacher.desmos.com/activitybuilder/custom/55c368cb6f0091a533ff7fd0">the teacher link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Questions for the Comments</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Obviously, I didn&#x2019;t invite hyperbolas and ellipses to the party. Which other loci should have received the same treatment?</li>
<li>Which Very Big Ideas did you only fully understand once you started math teaching?</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>I find this sort of gap fascinating [my inability to conceive of graphs as a picture of solutions &#x2013;<strong>dm</strong>] especially because it is likely somewhere along the line you were at least told this fact (you might even be able to track exactly where). But it still didn&#x2019;t stick! It&#x2019;s as if being told just isn&#x2019;t enough.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://blog.mrmeyer.com/2015/the-math-i-learned-after-i-thought-had-already-learned-math/comment-page-1/#comment-2409864">Bowen Kerins</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The description you give about graphs is something we have to hit early and often in CME Project, it&#x2019;s one of the top 3 things to learn in the entire curriculum. It&#x2019;s amazing how that can get lost in the shuffle, but it does, and where it gets lost is the algorithmic way of graphing a function or equation: the A does this, the B does that, etc &#x2014; all of this ignores the deeper fact that under the hood, this is all a relationship between two variables x and y.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other two of Bowen&#x2019;s top three things to learn in Algebra, <a href="https://twitter.com/bowenkerins/status/631248340190105600">according to Bowen on Twitter</a>, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Variables represent numbers, so test numbers to test ideas and build equations.</li>
<li>Rules for new stuff should respect existing rules.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Featured Tweets</strong></p>
<p>Amazing, all the people <a href="https://twitter.com/ddmeyer/status/631161953889599488">unburdening themselves on Twitter</a> of math they only understood once they began teaching. <em>What does it all mean?</em></p>
