 <h2>Abstract</h2>
 <p>
 Scholarly HTML is a domain-specific data format built entirely on open standards that
 enables the interoperable exchange of scholarly articles in a manner that is compatible
 with off-the-shelf browsers. This document describes how Scholarly HTML works and how it
 is encoded as a document. It is, itself, written in Scholarly HTML.
 </p>

 <h2>Motivation</h2>
 <aside>
 <p>
 This document is an early-stage release. While the underlying format is relatively
 mature and actually implemented, details are still in flux and the format can still be
 changed. The quality of this document is also being gradually improved. If you&#x2019;re
 interested in this project, come join
 <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io/">the party on GitHub</a>
 or talk to either <a href="https://twitter.com/sciencedotai">@sciencedotai</a> or
 <a href="https://twitter.com/robinberjon">@robinberjon</a> in Twitter.
 </p>
 </aside>
 <p>
 Scholarly articles are still primarily encoded as unstructured graphics formats in which
 most of the information initially created by research, or even just in the text, is lost.
 This was an acceptable, if deplorable, condition when viable alternatives did not seem
 possible, but document technology has today reached a level of maturity and universality
 that makes this situation no longer tenable. Information cannot be disseminated if it is
 destroyed before even having left its creator&#x2019;s laptop.
 </p>
 <p>
 According to the New York Times, adding structured information to their recipes (instead
 of exposing simply as plain text) improved their discoverability to the point of producing
 an immediate rise of 52 percent in traffic (<a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#ref-nyt">NYT, 2014</a>). At this point in time, cupcake recipes are
 reaping greater benefits from modern data format practices than the whole scientific
 endeavour.
 </p>
 <p>
 This is not solely a loss for the high principles of knowledge sharing in science, it also
 has very immediate pragmatic consequences. Any tool, any service that tries to integrate
 with scholarly publishing has to spend the brunt of its complexity (or budget) extracting
 data the author would have willingly shared out of antiquated formats. This places
 stringent limits on the improvement of the scholarly toolbox, on the discoverability of
 scientific knowledge, and particularly on processes of meta-analysis.
 </p>
 <p>
 To address these issues, we have followed an approach rooted in established best practices
 for the reuse of open, standard formats. The &#xAB;HTML Vernacular&#xBB; body of practice provides
 guidelines for the creation of domain-specific data formats that make use of HTML&#x2019;s
 inherent extensibility (<a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#ref-vernacular">Science.AI,
 2015b</a>). Using the vernacular foundation overlaid with &#xAB;schema.org&#xBB; metadata we have
 produced a format for the interchange of scholarly articles built on open standards, ready
 for all to use.
 </p>
 <p>
 Our high-level goals were:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 Uncompromisingly enabling structured metadata, accessibility, and internationalisation.
 </li>
 <li>
 Pragmatically working in Web browsers, even if it occasionally incurs some markup
 overhead.
 </li>
 <li>
 Powerfully customisable for inclusion in arbitrary Web sites, while remaining easy to
 process and interoperable.
 </li>
 <li>
 Entirely built on top of open, royalty-free standards.
 </li>
 <li>
 Long-term viability as a data format.
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Additionally, in view of the specific problem we addressed, in the creation of this
 vernacular we have favoured the reliability of interchange over ease of authoring; but
 have nevertheless attempted to cater to the latter as much as possible. A decent
 boilerplate template file can certainly make authoring relatively simple, but not as
 radically simple as it can be. For such use cases, Scholarly HTML provides a great output
 target and overview of the data model required to support scholarly publishing at the
 document level.
 </p>
 <p>
 An example of an authoring format that was designed to target Scholarly HTML as an
 output is the <a href="http://scienceai.github.io/docx-standard-scientific-style">DOCX
 Standard Scientific Style</a> which enables authors who are comfortable with Microsoft
 Word to author documents that have a direct upgrade path to semantic, standard content.
 </p>
 <p>
 Where semantic modelling is concerned, our approach is to stick as much as possible to
 <a href="http://schema.org/">schema.org</a>. Beyond the obvious advantages there are in
 reusing a vocabulary that is supported by all the major search engines and is actively
 being developed towards enabling a shared understanding of many useful concepts, it also
 provides a protection against &#xAB;<em>ontological drift</em>&#xBB; whereby a new vocabulary is
 defined by a small group with insufficient input from a broader community of practice.
 A language that solely a single participant understands is of limited value.
 </p>
 <p>
 In a small, circumscribed number of cases we have had to depart from
 <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>, using the <code>https://ns.science.ai/</code>
 (prefixed with <code>sa:</code>) vocabulary instead
 (<a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#ref-sa-ontology">Science.AI, 2015a</a>). Our goal is
 to work with <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> in order to extend their
 vocabulary, and we will align our usage with the outcome of these discussions.
 </p>

 <section id="definition">
 <h2>Definition</h2>
 <p>
 A <dfn id="scholarly-html">Scholarly HTML document</dfn> is a valid HTML document that
 follows some additional rules to specialised its meaning and make it predictable to
 processors wishing to produce or consume scholarly articles. These rules are outlined in
 the following sections.
 </p>
 <p>
 Please note that in its current state this specification is often informal in the manner
 in which it describes its constraints. This is to facilitate review by people unfamiliar
 with formal specification writing. As the format solidifies, it will be made more formal
 progressively (but attempt to remain readable).
 </p>
 
 <section id="article">
 <h3>Article Structure</h3>
 <p>
 The article content is everything that is contained inside the first
 <code>article</code> element in document order that has a
 <code>typeof="schema:ScholarlyArticle"</code>. Everything part of the <code>body</code>
 outside of that subtree is ignored. This enables publishers to surround the article
 content with any amount of supporting markup, for instance for headers, footers,
 or navigation, as well as to wrap the article inside arbitrary markup that may be
 needed for stylistic reasons.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>article</code> element should have
 a <code>resource</code> attribute, usually with a value
 of <code>#</code>. The reason for that is to grant it a
 URL that can be targeted by other properties. The
 <code>resource</code> attribute can take any value, but it
 must then be matched by the
 <code>about</code> attributes of the properties targeting
 it. If <code>resource</code> is omitted, the only way in
 which those properties can target it is by knowing the URL
 from which the document was retrieved.
 </p>
 <p>
 The first element child of the <code>article</code> element must be an <code>h1</code>
 heading that serves as the primary title for the document. It may itself contain markup.
 The white-space-normalised text value of the <code>h1</code> must appear as a substring
 of the white-space-normalised text value of the <code>title</code> element. This ensures
 semantic alignment between the two, while enabling publishers to add their name to the
 <code>title</code> so as to identify themselves there alongside the content.
 </p>
 <p>
 Any children of <code>article</code> that are not <code>section</code> elements are
 ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
 The first <code>section</code> child element of the <code>article</code> must be the
 <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#authors">Authors and Affiliations</a> section. It has no <code>typeof</code>
 and its specific rules are outlined in its own chapter below.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>section</code> elements can be nested arbitrarily deep. Each
 <code>section</code> element must have as its first element child an <code>hX</code>
 heading element the numeric part of which must be the number of <code>section</code>
 ancestor elements that heading elements has up to the <code>article</code> element, plus
 one. If the numeric part is greater than 6, then <code>h6</code> must be used but an
 <code>aria-level</code> attribute must be added that reflects the accurate depth.
 (The <code>aria-level</code> attribute can be used at lower depths but is not required
 there.)
 </p>
 <p>
 Each <code>section</code> element may contain an arbitrary number of
 <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a>, followed by an arbitrary number of
 <code>section</code> elements being subsections. Note that
 <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a> must imperatively appear <em>before</em> the
 subsections.
 </p>
 <p>
 Sections are expected to be typed using the <code>typeof</code> attribute. The following
 <code>typeof</code> values are currently understood:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li><code>sa:Funding</code> (which has its <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#funding">specific structure</a>)</li>
 <li><code>sa:Abstract</code></li>
 <li><code>sa:MaterialsAndMethods</code></li>
 <li><code>sa:Results</code></li>
 <li><code>sa:Conclusion</code></li>
 <li><code>sa:Acknowledgements</code></li>
 <li><code>sa:ReferenceList</code></li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Hopefully these types are largely self-documenting, they are described further in the
 Scholarly Article ontology
 (<a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#ref-sa-ontology">Science.AI, 2015a</a>).
 </p>
 <p>
 The section typed <code>sa:ReferenceList</code> has special processing rules described
 in the <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#references-section">References section</a>.
 </p>
 </section>
 <section id="hunk-elements">
 <h3>Hunk Elements</h3>
 <p>
 <dfn>Hunk elements</dfn> are the meaningful blocks from which sections are built. They
 contain text and <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#inline-element">inline elements</a>. There are several
 types of hunk elements.
 </p>
 <p>
 The most common hunk element is <code>p</code>, which is used to capture paragraphs. It
 requires no special processing.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>blockquote</code>, <code>ul</code>, <code>ol</code>, and <code>dl</code>
 elements can be used as they typically would and require no special treatment.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>aside</code> hunk element is used to capture text boxes. If it contains an
 <code>hX</code> heading element, that element must be its first element child and its
 numeric part must reflect its depth, making use of <code>aria-level</code> according to
 the same rules as apply for <code>section</code>. The other children of
 <code>aside</code> must all be hunk elements.
 </p>
 <p>
 The <code>figure</code> element is a general container for content units that are
 embedded inside the main body of the text. It can come in several flavours that are
 dictated by its <code>typeof</code> attribute.
 </p>
 <p>
 If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Image"</code> then it is an image container.
 It must contain an <code>img</code> child element and should contain a
 <code>figcaption</code> labelling that image. An example of an image figure would be:
 </p>
 <figure>

 in Extinct Giant Kangaroos: Were Sthenurines Hop-Less Monsters?</a></cite>&#xBB;, by
 Christine M. Janis, Karalyn Buttrill, Borja Figueirido.
 </figcaption>
 </figure>
 <p>
 If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Table"</code> then it is a table container.
 It must contain nothing other than a <code>table</code> element. If a caption is
 available, it should be included using the <code>caption</code> child element of the
 <code>table</code>, and not the <code>figcaption</code> child of the
 <code>figure</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="sa:Formula"</code> then it is a formula
 container. It must contain a <code>math</code> element and optionally a
 <code>figcaption</code> describing the formula. The <code>math</code> element must be
 valid MathML 3. Additionally, given the dismal state of support for MathML in Web
 browser the <code>math</code> element must contain an <code>annotation</code>
 descendant with the TeX equivalent of the formula.
 </p>
 <p>
 If <code>figure</code> has <code>typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode"</code>
 then it is a code container. It must contain a <code>pre</code> element
 and optionally a <code>figcaption</code>. The <code>pre</code> element must contain as
 its only child a <code>code</code> element.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you wish to specify the type of the language used in the code, the
 <code>figure</code> needs to have a <code>schema:programmingLanguage</code> property
 containing a type <code>schema:Language</code>, itself with a <code>schema:name</code>
 containing the the lowercase name of one of the languages from the
 <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/list-of-programming-languages/blob/master/data/data.jsonld">list
 of programming languages</a>. Canonically, this would look like the following source:
 </p>
 <figure>
 <meta name="schema:name" value="html">
 <pre><code class="language-html">
&lt;figure typeof="schema:SoftwareSourceCode"&gt;
 &lt;pre property="schema:programmingLanguage" typeof="schema:Language"&gt;
 &lt;meta property="schema:name" content="python"&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;import foo&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
 How to import foo.
 &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

 <section id="inline-elements">
 <h3>Inline Elements</h3>
 <p>
 <dfn>Inline elements</dfn> essentially decorate, describe, and enrich text. Inside of
 <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#hunk-elements">hunk elements</a>, of heading elements, and of captioning
 elements (<code>caption</code> and <code>figcaption</code>) the following inline
 elements can be used (and where applicable they can nest within one another):
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li><code>a</code></li>
 <li><code>abbr</code></li>
 <li><code>bdi</code></li>
 <li><code>bdo</code></li>
 <li><code>cite</code></li>
 <li><code>code</code></li>
 <li><code>data</code></li>
 <li><code>del</code></li>
 <li><code>dfn</code></li>
 <li><code>em</code></li>
 <li><code>img</code> (for small, contextual images that should not be figures)</li>
 <li><code>ins</code></li>
 <li><code>kbd</code></li>
 <li><code>mark</code></li>
 <li><code>math</code> (for inline equations that should not be figures; they must also
 contain a TeX annotation)</li>
 <li><code>meter</code></li>
 <li><code>q</code></li>
 <li><code>ruby</code> (with embedded <code>rb</code>, <code>rt</code>, <code>rtc</code>,
 and <code>rp</code>)</li>
 <li><code>samp</code></li>
 <li><code>span</code></li>
 <li><code>strong</code></li>
 <li><code>sub</code></li>
 <li><code>sup</code></li>
 <li><code>svg</code> (for small, contextual images that should not be figures)</li>
 <li><code>time</code></li>
 <li><code>var</code></li>
 <li><code>wbr</code></li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 If an <code>a</code> element is linking to a citation, then it must have
 <code>property="schema:citation"</code>; if it is linking
 to a figure or another creative work, it must
 have <code>property="schema:hasPart"</code>
 or <code>property="schema:isBasedOnUrl"</code>. These are
 known as <dfn>flavoured links</dfn>, they can be used to
 enhance the user experience by treating their behaviour
 differently from regular links.
 </p>
 </section>
 <section id="references-section">
 <h3>The References Section</h3>
 <p>
 The references section is a special type of <code>section</code> element with
 <code>typeof="sa:ReferenceList"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Apart from its heading element, it must contain nothing other than an <code>ol</code>
 or a <code>dl</code> element.
 </p>
 <p>
 If using a <code>dl</code> element, its content must be exclusively a strictly
 alternating sequence of <code>dt</code> then <code>dd</code> elements, with the latter
 being the citation-bearing element. The <code>dt</code> is used as a label in some
 citation formats.
 </p>
 <p>
 If using an <code>ol</code>, then its content is only <code>li</code> elements that are
 the citation-bearing elements.
 </p>
 <p>
 The citation-bearing element will have an <code>id</code> and be
 <code>schema:Book</code> for books or
 <code>typeof="schema:ScholarlyArticle"</code> (or its subclass
 <code>schema:MedicalScholarlyArticle</code>, with probably more to come). Its
 content follows the &#xAB;flexcite&#xBB; format (being defined as part of this document, see
 <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io/issues/4">#4</a>). The
 references section of this document is an example.
 </p>

&lt;/li&gt;
 </code></pre>
 <figcaption>
 A citation (not yet in Flexcite format).
 </figcaption>
 </figure>
 <p>
 At the semantics level, a citation is a <code>schema:ScholarlyArticle</code> (or subtype)
 with an <code>id</code> to reference it internally in the document and a
 <code>resource</code> that is a URL identifying it (its DOI for instance, preferable in
 HTTP-retrievable form).
 </p>
 <p>
 That <code>schema:ScholarlyArticle</code> has any number of <code>schema:author</code>
 which are <code>schema:Person</code> (with the usual <code>schema:givenName</code>,
 <code>schema:familyName</code>, etc.). A child <code>cite</code> element, with
 <code>property="schema:name"</code> (and optionally a link child) provides the title
 of the article.
 </p>
 <p>
 The publisher is described using a nested <code>schema:isPartOf</code> structure of
 <code>schema:PublicationIssue</code>, <code>schema:PublicationVolume</code>,
 and <code>schema:Periodical</code> (with only those that are known being used). Both
 <code>schema:volumeNumber</code> and <code>schema:issueNumber</code> may be used on the
 volume and issue.
 </p>
 <p>
 A <code>time</code> element with <code>property="schema:datePublished"</code> provides
 the publication date, which is expressed in text in human-readable form and in the
 <code>datetime</code> attribute in standard form. A <code>datatype</code> attribute
 matching the date format must be provided.
 </p>
 <p>
 Both <code>schema:pageStart</code> and <code>schema:pageEnd</code> may be provided.
 </p>
 <p>
 Beyond the semantics, a more specific serialisation known a &#xAB;Flexcite&#xBB; is in the works
 and will be added here soon. Its properties are simple: when unstyled it reads linearly
 in a human-friendly manner (so as to be accessible), and it can be styled with CSS to be
 turned into arbitrary citation style preferences.

 <h3>The Authors &amp; Affiliations Section</h3>
 <p>
 Capturing authors, the affiliations and their relationship to the article is the most
 intricate part of Scholarly HTML. Care was taken to avoid repetition and to keep the
 markup density as reasonable as possible, but the data to content ratio remains
 relatively high.
 </p>
 <p>
 It is probably best to start from an example and then to explain it:
 </p>

 <figure>

 </figure>
 <p>
 The markup is relatively convoluted, but the data model is rich:
 </p>
 <figure>
 <img src="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/affiliations.png" width="976">
 <figcaption>
 The data model that matches the code
 </figcaption>
 </figure>
 <p>
 This <code>section</code> has no <code>typeof</code> and
 no heading element. It contains a first <code>ol</code>
 which lists authors, and optionally a
 second <code>ol</code> to list affiliations.
 </p>
 <p>
 Each <code>li</code> in the authors <code>ol</code> has
 <code>property="schema:author"</code> or <code>property="schema:contributor"</code> and a
 <code>typeof="sa:ContributorRole"</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 A <code>sa:ContributorRole</code> type (following the
 semantic of
 schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/Role">Role</a>) is
 used so that affiliations or contact informations (email
 address, etc.) relevant to this specific scholarly article
 (and this specific scholarly article only) can be
 specified. This is important as authors may have different
 affiliations and contact points at the time they are
 publishing a scholarly article but may want to specify
 only a subset of those. Readers not familiar with the
 semantic of schema.org Role can consult
 the <a href="http://blog.schema.org/2014/06/introducing-role.html">introductory
 blog post</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Inside of that <code>li</code>, arbitrary properties
 of <code>schema:Person</code>, filling
 the <code>schema:author</code> property of
 the <code>sa:ContributorRole</code> can be specified, but
 providing at least <code>schema:givenName</code> and
 <code>schema:familyName</code>. It is recommended that
 these properties are wrapped into an hyperlink
 identifying the person with a URL to their home page,
 their <a href="http://orcid.org/">ORCID</a>, or an email
 address.
 </p>
 <p>
 If there is an affiliations <code>ol</code> and a given
 author is affiliated, there must be an <code>a</code>
 element with its <code>href</code> pointing to that
 affiliation, a <code>resource</code> matching the URL
 identifying the affiliation,
 and <code>property="schema:roleAffiliation"</code>. The
 content of that <code>a</code> element must be a string
 that matches the one that will be generated by CSS to
 label the affiliation; Latin lowercase being
 recommended. (This is a hack, but we can only do so much
 within the limits of CSS &#x2014; better <code>counter</code>
 would be needed.)
 </p>
 <p>
 If an author (or contributor) is a corresponding author, a
 last <code>sup</code> element needs to be added to
 its <code>li</code>
 with <code>property="sa:roleContactPoint"</code>, <code>typeof="schema:ContactPoint"</code>
 (or subclass). Inside the <code>sup</code> element, there
 must be at least a link to the contributor email address
 (<code>mailto:</code>). More contact information such a as
 properties of <code>schema:PostalAddress</code> may be
 added using <code>meta</code> tags.
 </p>
 <p>
 If there is an affiliations <code>ol</code>, each <code>li</code> in it must have an
 <code>id</code> which the authors link to. In turn it contains an <code>a</code>
 element linking to the affiliation with <code>typeof</code> set to either
 <code>schema:Organization</code> or <a href="http://schema.org/Organization">one of its
 subtypes</a>. Inside the <code>a</code> needs to sit a <code>span</code> (or any
 acceptable element, really) with <code>property="schema:name"</code>, containing the
 name.

 <h3>The Funding Section</h3>
 <p>
 The funding information attached to an article involves a list of sponsors each of which
 offers a list of funding sources. Again, an example probably makes the idea clearer:

 The section has <code>typeof="sa:Funding"</code> and an arbitrary heading title, like
 other sections.
 </p>
 <p>
 It contains a series of <a href="http://scholarly.vernacular.io/#hunk-elements">hunks</a> that are
 <code>rel="schema:sponsor"</code> (there can also be other content, it is ignored for
 our purposes). The example above uses a <code>p</code> and a narrative style for its
 content, but you have freedom to use other encodings.
 </p>
 <p>
 As for contributor affiliations, source of fundings are
 expressed using a subclass of <code>schema:Role</code> (<code>sa:SponsorRole</code>).
 The usage of schema.org <code>Role</code> type is needed
 to describe the source of fundings specific to a scholarly
 article as opposed to all the source of funding of an
 organization (relevant or not to our scholarly article of
 interest).
 </p>
 <p>
 The funder will be <code>typeof="schema:Organization"</code> (or a subtype thereof), as the object of a
 <code>schema:sponsor</code> property on the <code>sa:SponsorRole</code>. It
 will be identified through its URL (as in the <code>a</code> above), and will typically
 have <code>schema:name</code> and often <code>schema:alternateName</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
 The specific source of funding is of type <code>sa:FundingSource</code>, as the object of a
 <code>sa:roleOffer</code> property on the <code>sa:SponsorRole</code>. It
 should have a URL identifying it and a <code>schema:serialNumber</code> that is its
 labeled identity.

 <h3>Data rich scholarly articles</h3>
 <p>
 Scholarly Articles are often part of a larger network of
 creative works containing dataset, code, additional
 figures, tables or media (audio, video). Even within a
 scholarly article, some creative works can be encoded in
 different ways (for instance, figures typically comes in
 different resolutions). Scholarly HTML aims to formally
 describe (and help archive) this larger context.
 </p>
 <p>
 Further data about a scholarly graph can be exposed within
 the article in RDFa or as
 <a href="http://json-ld.org">JSON-LD</a> islands. When
 JSON-LD is used, it is recommended not to duplicate the
 data already serialized in RDFa. JSON-LD should be
 reserved to expose data not directly present in the HTML
 markup.

 <h3>Semantic context of a scholarly article</h3>
 <p>
 Scholarly Articles (and their associated resources) are
 frequently tagged to improve their discoverability. For
 instance,
 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine">National
 Library of Medicine</a> uses
 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings">Medical
 Subject Headings</a> (MeSH) controlled vocabulary to index
 journal articles in the life sciences. Scholarly HTML
 leverages schema.org and the <code>schema:about</code>
 property to efficiently expose this information to search
 engines. When possible,
 schema.org <a href="http://schema.org/MedicalEntity">MedicalEntity</a>
 (and subclasses) should be used to describe biomedical
 concepts.

 <h3>Hypermedia controls</h3>
 <p>
 A Scholarly Article (or any resource part of a scholarly
 graph) can be made actionable with the addition of
 hypermedia controls provided
 through <a href="http://schema.org/Action">schema.org
 actions</a>. Readers not familiar with schema.org Actions
 should refer to
 the <a href="http://schema.org/docs/actions.html">actions
 overview document</a> for a quick introduction.

 <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
 <p>
 Scholarly HTML would like to thank <a href="http://scholarlyhtml.org/">Scholarly HTML</a>
 (you read that right) for blazing the trail perhaps a few years too soon. Particularly,
 the following people were particularly kind and helpful:
 <a href="https://twitter.com/ptsefton">Peter Sefton</a>,
 <a href="https://twitter.com/blahah404">Richard Smith-Unna</a>, and
 <a href="https://twitter.com/petermurrayrust">Peter Murray-Rust</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 PLOS has a
 <a href="http://blogs.plos.org/mfenner/2011/03/19/a-very-brief-history-of-scholarly-html/">short
 history of Scholarly HTML</a> that is worth reading (and would be worth updating).
 </p>
 <p>
 Dan Brickley was kind enough to drop by the office to chat about our usage of
 <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a> even though he was tired and hungry. As always,
 examples involving fish tanks are the most helpful. Tzviya Siegman and Dave Cramer have
 shared ideas that we happily stole.
 </p>
 <p>
 Patrick Johnston's input has been crucial, notably in modelling authoring. We can only
 hope that getting those details exactly right have not caused him to lose too much sleep.
 </p>
 <p>
 We also received very useful feedback and pointers from: Kjetil Kjernsmo (DAHUT!), Silvio
 Peroni, Justin Johansson, Alf Eaton, Raniere Silvia, and Mike Smith.
 </p>
 <p>
 If we somehow forgot you in this list and you are too gracious to complain, we love you
 all the same.

 <section id="conclusion">
 <h2>Conclusion</h2>
 <p>
 Scholarly HTML is currently a work in progress and is open to change. If you have
 feedback, simply
 <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io/issues">open an issue</a> on
 GitHub, or <a href="https://github.com/scienceai/scholarly.vernacular.io">make a pull
 request</a>.
 </p>
 <p>
 We believe that this vernacular establishes that it is possible to capture scholarly
 information accurately, while retaining a clean HTML structure that does minimum violence
 to the language&#x2019;s spirit.
 </p>
 <p>
 The science.ai platform currently supports (most of) Scholarly HTML, but our goal is not
 to make this a proprietary standard &#x2014; quite the opposite. We would like the scholarly
 publishing as much as possible to align with common practices so that we can all focus on
 problems more interesting than content conversion.
