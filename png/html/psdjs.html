<p>A Photoshop file format (PSD) parser written in Coffeescript/Javascript for both browsers and NodeJS implementations.</p>

<p>This implementation is more or less a direct port of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pypsd" rel="nofollow">pypsd</a> with some help from <a href="https://github.com/jerem/psdparse" rel="nofollow">psdparse</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Please note: this is a work in progress and is not finished yet. Do not use in production anywhere.</strong></p>



<p>If you would like to contribute to psd.js, you can refer to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml/" rel="nofollow">official PSD file format specifications</a> for help.</p>

<h3>Building psd.js</h3>

<p>psd.js comes with a handy Cakefile to build the library for you. It first searches for all dependencies in the <code>deps/</code> folder, then adds the core library afterwards in the order speciifed in the Cakefile.</p>

<p>To build, simply run <code>cake build</code>. If you would like the library to automatically build after any source files are saved, you can run <code>cake watch</code>.</p></article></div>
