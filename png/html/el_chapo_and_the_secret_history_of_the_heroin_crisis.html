How did they respond to a major loss in revenue? Like any company, they created an irresistible new product and flooded the market. The scariest part: this might not have happened with El Chapo in charge. </em></p><div class="ad-gpt-breaker-container"><div class="ad-gpt-breaker ad-article-breaker-mobile "><p class="ad-article-breaker-text">Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p></div></div><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">The phone rang. It was July 2014, and I was in a motel room in Tucumcari, New Mexico, about to step into the shower. My wife and I were two days into a cross-country drive from our home in California, and I wanted to clean up before we went to a sports bar across the parking lot to grab something to eat.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">Looking at the phone, I recognized the number and felt my heart drop. The woman was a close friend. Her twenty-three-year-old son had struggled with heroin addiction for several years.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">I knew the young man. He was smart, talented, funny&#x2014;and charming when he wasn't high or jonesing. He was supposed to have called me that day to discuss getting back into school.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">I didn't get that call.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">It was his mother on the phone, sobbing, barely able to stammer out the words that I already knew she was going to say. "He's gone."</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">That afternoon, she told me, he was walking to a treatment center that finally had a bed for him, but he stopped for one last "get well" fix. He died on the sidewalk.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">His mother and I were on the phone for quite a while. Mostly I listened, because what was there to say? Then I got into the shower and cried.</p><div class="ad-gpt-breaker-container"><div class="ad-gpt-breaker ad-article-breaker-tablet "><p class="ad-article-breaker-text">Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p></div></div><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">I've been writing about and researching the so-called War on Drugs for more than twenty years. During that time I've been to funerals, I've sat with the families of teenage hitmen, I've explained to people why their loved ones were killed, providing information that the government would not. I've analyzed autopsy photos, trying to put names to anonymous victims. I've watched the atrocity videos. I thought I was inured to it, hardened to insensitivity by the numbing sameness of this never-ending tragedy. I thought I was beyond tears.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">This one hurt. It was personal (<em>why hadn't he called me, why the fuck hadn't he called me?</em>), and, moreover, I knew how it had happened.</p><div class="pullquote pullquote-C longform-article-body-el-pullquote-C">
<i class="icon icon-quote"></i><p>It was his mother on the phone, sobbing, barely able to stammer out the words that I already knew she was going to say. "He's gone."</p></div><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">The heroin that killed him came from Mexico. The people who grew the poppies, manufactured the drug, and shipped it north were members of Mexico's most powerful drug-trafficking organization, and the death of my friend's son came as a direct result of a business decision made by several of these men.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">One of them was Joaqu&#xED;n Guzm&#xE1;n Loera.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">The jefe of the Sinaloa Cartel, the largest drug trafficker in the world. Aka "El Chapo."</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">Yeah, him.</p><div class="embedded-image embedded-image--RL longform-article-embedded-image--RL longform-article-body-el-image"><div class="embedded-image--inner">

(I resist calling him El Chapo because the diminutive makes him seem like some sort of cute Disney dwarf who whistles while he works rather than the mass murderer he is.) I remember the days when young Joaqu&#xED;n was learning the <em>pista secreta</em> as an errand boy/driver for the old giants of the trade, such as Pedro Avil&#xE9;s P&#xE9;rez and Rafael Caro Quintero.</p><p class="body-el-text longform-body-el-text">Guzm&#xE1;n had worked and killed his way up to the big leagues by the time he first went to prison, in 1993. While he was running his business from his suite inside Puente Grande federal prison, I was working on a book called <em>The Power of the Dog,</em> the first of three novels I've written about the evolution of the Mexican drug scene. I was talking to cops and convicts, drug traffickers and addicts, gangbangers and their families. I was in the prisons and on the streets, in the archives and the courts, on the border and across it. I was still working on that book when Guzm&#xE1;n made his first escape in 2001.</p></div><div class="ad-article-breaker longform-article-body-el-breaker"><div class="ad-gpt-breaker-container"><div class="ad-gpt-breaker "><p class="ad-article-breaker-text">Advertisement - Continue Reading Below</p></div></div></div></div>
