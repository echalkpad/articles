Neuroscience has demonstrated that individual differences in cognitive task performance are closely linked to differences in brain activity. Neurofeedback training based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can effectively change specific localized brain activity. Various studies in healthy volunteers and patients have shown that self-regulation of specific brain activity can be learned with fMRI neurofeedback, and leads to specific corresponding behavioral changes. Initial evidence for cognitive enhancement due to fMRI neurofeedback include the domains of perception, motor performance, and memory. Although further conceptual and technical advances are needed to overcome current limitations of this novel method, its non-invasiveness and compatibility with other behavioral or pharmacological approaches promise that it will become a powerful tool for cognitive enhancement.

## Introduction

Neuroscientific research has firmly established that individual differences in cognitive task performance are closely linked to differences in brain functioning. For example, the level of activity in specialized brain areas such as the visual cortex, which can change spontaneously and as a function of perceptual training or attention, is associated with improved visual detection [[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0335), [2](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0340) and [3](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0345)]. This also holds for more complex cognitive functions such as working memory and intelligence, which are associated with specific patterns of activity, in particular the prefrontal cortex [[4](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0350), [5](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0355), [6](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0360), [7](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0365) and [8](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0370)]. Damage to these brain areas can result in severe visual impairment, or memory problems, respectively [[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0335), [9](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0375) and [10](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352154615000625#bib0380)]. The close link between cognitive task performance and brain states strongly suggests that optimizing brain activity improves cognitive performance. Neurofeedback is a promising approach to manipulating brain states that is non-invasive and does not require pharmacological substances. The rationale behind cognitive enhancement based on neurofeedback is to train participants to reach brain states that have been identified to correspond to optimum levels of task performance. Depending on the task, the optimal brain states that ought to be trained with neurofeedback can be associated with enhanced attention, particular mental strategies, brain patterns evoked by specific stimuli, or any other brain state that might be promising to increase task performance. For example, improved visual sensitivity has been achieved by neurofeedback training of attention-related increases in spontaneous visual cortex activity [

], as well as by training visual cortex activation patterns that corresponded to a specific visual stimulus [

## Neurofeedback

Neurofeedback training is accomplished by continuously measuring brain activity, analyzing it in real-time, and then providing feedback regarding the current brain state to the participant [

). Feedback information is crucial for learning, and neurofeedback makes information about hidden brain states accessible to our consciousness. It thus provides a reinforcement signal to induce conditioning-type learning mechanisms, and also allows individuals to search for appropriate mental strategies to voluntarily control brain activity (

Figure 1\. Schematic setup and data flow in real-time fMRI neurofeedback experiments. Participants are instructed to regulate brain activity. Local brain activity is measured using an MRI scanner. Real-time data pre-processing and analysis is performed with dedicated software. Feedback is provided to the participant in the scanner via a projector (e.g. in the form of a thermometer icon, with the temperature reading indicating the current level of brain activity/connectivity). With the help of the feedback information, participants can learn to voluntarily control brain activity in the targeted brain areas.

Figure 2\. Example neurofeedback training. Participants perform several training runs of approximately 10 min duration, which are composed of baseline blocks and up-regulation blocks. During the up-regulation blocks the target-level indicator of the thermometer display moves up, which indicates to the participants that they should increase activity in the targeted brain region. Participants are presented feedback about their success via, for example, a thermometer icon. With the help of the feedback signal and by trial and error, participants learn voluntary control of activity in the targeted brain region.
